PREFACE 
 
To Volume 2 
 
 
This is the second volume of a two-volume work on vectors and tensors.  Volume 1 is concerned 
with the algebra of vectors and tensors, while this volume is concerned with the geometrical 
aspects of vectors and tensors.  This volume begins with a discussion of Euclidean manifolds.  The 
principal mathematical entity considered in this volume is a field, which is defined on a domain in a 
Euclidean manifold.  The values of the field may be vectors or tensors.  We investigate results due 
to the distribution of the vector or tensor values of the field on its domain.  While we do not discuss 
general differentiable manifolds, we do include a chapter on vector and tensor fields defined on 
hypersurfaces in a Euclidean manifold. 
 
 This volume contains frequent references to Volume 1.  However, references are limited to 
basic algebraic concepts, and a student with a modest background in linear algebra should be able 
to utilize this volume as an independent textbook.  As indicated in the preface to Volume 1, this 
volume is suitable for a one-semester course on vector and tensor analysis.  On occasions when we 
have taught a one –semester course, we covered material from Chapters 9, 10, and 11 of this 
volume.  This course also covered the material in Chapters 0,3,4,5, and 8 from Volume 1. 
 
We wish to thank the U.S. National Science Foundation for its support during the 
preparation of this work.  We also wish to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Kurt Reinicke for 
critically checking the entire manuscript and offering improvements on many points.

EUCLIDEAN MANIFOLDS 
 
 
This chapter is the first where the algebraic concepts developed thus far are combined with 
ideas from analysis.  The main concept to be introduced is that of a manifold.  We will discuss here 
only a special case cal1ed a Euclidean manifold.  The reader is assumed to be familiar with certain 
elementary concepts in analysis, but, for the sake of completeness, many of these shall be inserted 
when needed. 
 
Section 43     Euclidean Point Spaces  
 
Consider an inner produce space V and a set E.  The set E is a Euclidean point space if 
there exists a function :f×→EEV such that: 
 
(a) (, )(,)(, ),, ,fff=+∈xyxzzyxyzE 
and 
(b) For every ∈xE and ∈vV there exists a unique element ∈yE such that 
(, )f=xyv. 
 
The elements of E are called points, and the inner product space V is called the translation space.  
We say that 
(, )fxy is the vector determined by the end point x and the initial point y.  Condition 
b) above is equivalent to requiring the function :f
→
x
EV defined by (  )(  ,   )ff=
x
yxy to be one to 
one for each 
x
.  The dimension of E, written dimE, is defined to be the dimension of V.  If V 
does not have an inner product, the set 
E
 defined above is called an affine space. 
 
A Euclidean point space is not a vector space but a vector space with inner product is made 
a Euclidean point space by defining 
121    2
(, )f≡−vvvv for all 
∈vV
.  For an arbitrary point space 
the function 
f is called the point difference, and it is customary to use the suggestive notation 
 
 
(, )f=−xyxy                                                          (43.1)                                                          
 
In this notation (a) and (b) above take the forms

Proof.  For  (i) take 
==xyz in (43.2); then 
 
 
−=−+−xx xxxx
 
 
which implies 
−=xx 0.  To obtain (ii) take =yx in (43.2) and use (i).  For  (iii) observe that  
 
 
'''''−=−+−=−+−xyxyyyxx xy
 
 
from (43.2).  However, we are given ''
−=−xyxy which implies (iii). 
 
The equation 
 
 
−=xyv
 
 
has the property that given any 
v
 and y, x is uniquely determined.  For this reason it is customary 
to write 
 
 
=+xyv                                                              (43.5)

It easily fol1ows from the definition (43.6) and the properties of the inner product that 
 
                                                                   (, )(, )dd

and 
 
                                                            (, )(,)    (, )ddd

for all    ,
xy, and z in E.  Equation (43.8) is simply rewritten in terms of the points    ,xy, and z 
rather than the vectors ,
−−xyxz, and −zy.  It is also apparent from (43.6) that 
 
                                              (, )  0and(, )  0dd

The properties (43.7)-(43.9) establish that 
E is a metric space. 
 
There are several concepts from the theory of metric spaces which we need to summarize.  
For simplicity the definitions are sated here in terms of Euclidean point spaces only even though 
they can be defined for metric spaces in general. 
 
In a Euclidean point space 
E an open ball of radius

and a closed ball is the set

00
(,)(, )Bdεε=≤xxxx                                               (43.11)                                               
 
A neighborhood of 
∈xE
 is a set which contains an open ball centered at x.  A subset 
U
 of 
E
 is 
open if it is a neighborhood of each of its points.  The empty set 
∅ is trivially open because it 
contains no points.  It also follows from the definitions that 
E is open. 
 
Theorem 43.2.  An open ball is an open set. 
 
Proof.  Consider the open ball 
0
(,)Bεx.  Let x be an arbitrary point in 
0
(,)Bεx.  Then 
0
(,  )  0dε−>xx and the open ball 
0
(,(,  ))Bdε−xxx is in 
0
(,)Bεx, because if 
0
(,(,  ))Bdε∈−yxxx, then 
0
(,)( ,)ddε<−yxxx and, by (43.8), 
00
(,)   (,)  (,)ddd≤+xyxxxy, 
which yields 
0
(,)dε<xy and, thus, 
0
(,)Bε∈yx. 
 
A subset 
U of E is closed if its complement, EU, is open.  It can be shown that closed 
balls are indeed closed sets.  The empty set, 
∅, is closed because =∅EE is open.  By the same 
logic 
E
 is closed since =∅EE is open.  In fact ∅ and 
E
 are the only subsets of 
E
 which are 
both open and closed.  A subset 
⊂UE
 is bounded if it is contained in some open ball.  A subset 
⊂UE is compact if it is closed and bounded. 
 
Theorem 43.3.  The union of any collection of open sets is open. 
 
Proof.  Let  
{}
I
α
α∈U be a collection of open sets, where I is an index set.  Assume that 
Iαα∈
∈xU∪.  Then 
x
 must belong to at least one of the sets in the collection, say 
0
α
U
.  Since 
0
α
U
 is 
open, there exists an open ball 
0
(, )
I
B
ααα
ε
∈
⊂⊂xUU∪.  Thus,    (  ,   )
I
B
αα
ε
∈
⊂xU∪.  Since x is 
arbitrary, 
Iαα∈
U∪ is open. 
 
Theorem43.4.  The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open. 
 
Proof.  Let  
{}
1
,...,
α
UU be a finite family of open sets.  If 
1
n
ii=
U∩ is empty, the assertion is trivial.  
Thus, assume 
1
n
ii=
U∩ is not empty and let x be an arbitrary element of 
1
n
ii=
U∩.  Then 
i
∈xU for 
1,...,in= and there is an open ball    (  ,   )
ii
Bε⊂xU for 1,...,in=.  Let ε be the smallest of the 
positive numbers 
1
,...,
n
εε.  Then 
1
(, )
n
ii
Bε
=
∈⊂xxU∩.  Thus 
1
n
ii=
U∩ is open.

It should be noted that arbitrary intersections of open sets will not always lead to open sets.  
The standard counter example is given by the family of open sets of R of the form

 we mean a function on the positive integers

1, 2, 3,...,  ,...n with values 
in E.  The notation

,,    ...,,...
n

x, is usually used to denote the values of the 
sequence.  A sequence

 is said to converge to a limit ∈xE if for every open ball    (  ,   )Bεx 
centered at x, there exists a positive integer 
0

Equivalently, a sequence

Proof.  Assume  that  
 
                                                                  lim,lim

Then, from (43.8) 
 
                                                          (, )(,  )(  , )

for every

 be an arbitrary positive real number.  Then from the definition of convergence 
of

dε<xy.  
Therefore, 
 
                                                                      (, )  2d

A point ∈xE is a limit point of a subset ⊂UE if every neighborhood of 
x
 contains a 
point of 
U
 distinct from x.  Note that x need not be in 
U
.  For example, the sphere 
{}
0
(,  )dε=xxx are limit points of the open ball 
0
(,)Bεx.  The closure of ⊂UE, written 
U
, is 
the union of U and its limit points.  For example, the closure of the open ball 
0
(,)Bεx is the 
closed ball 
0
(,)Bεx.  It is a fact that the closure of U is the smallest closed set containing U.  
Thus U is closed if and only if 
=UU
. 
 
The reader is cautioned not to confuse the concepts limit of a sequence and limit point of a 
subset.  A sequence is not a subset of E;  it is a function with values in E.  A sequence may have a 
limit when it has no limit point.  Likewise the set of pints which represent the values of a sequence 
may have a limit point when the sequence does not converge to a limit.  However, these two 
concepts are related by the following result from the theory of metric spaces: a point 
x
 is a limit 
point of a set 
U
 if and only if there exists a convergent sequence of distinct points of 
U
 with x as 
a limit. 
 
A mapping 
:'f→UE, where U is an open set in E and 'E is a Euclidean point space or 
an inner product space, is continuous at 
0
∈xU if for every real number 0ε> there exists a real 
number 
0
(,)0δε>x such that 
00
(,  )(,  )dδε<xxx implies 
0
'(   (    ),   (  ))dffε<xx.  Here 'd is the 
distance function for 
'E.  When f is continuous at 
0
x, it is conventional to write 
 
 
0
00
lim   (  )or(  )(    )   as   fff

→→
xx
xxxxx 
 
The mapping 
f is continuous on U if it is continuous at every point of U.  A continuous mapping 
is called a homomorphism if it is one-to-one and if its inverse is also continuous.  What we have 
just defined is sometimes called a homeomorphism into.  If a homomorphism is also onto, then it is 
called specifically a homeomorphism onto.  It is easily verified that a composition of two 
continuous maps is a continuous map and the composition of two homomorphisms is a 
homomorphism. 
 
A mapping :'f→
UE, where U and 'E are defined as before, is differentiable at ∈xU if 
there exists a linear transformation (   ;')

In the above definition 
'V denotes the translation space of 'E. 
 
Theorem 43.6.  The linear transformation 
x
A in (43.12) is unique. 
 
Proof.  If (43.12) holds for 
x
A and 
x
A, then by subtraction we find

By (43.13),

If 
f is differentiable at every point of U, then we can define a mapping 
grad:(    ;')f→ULVV, called the gradient of f, by 
 
                                                         grad   (  ),f

If 
gradf is continuous on U, then f is said to be of class 
1
C.  If gradf exists and is 
itself of class 
1
C, then f is of class 
2
C.  More generally, f is of class 
r
C, 0r>, if it is of class 
1r

−
 and its (1)r−st gradient, written

f

, is of class 
1
C.  Of course, f is of class 
0
C if it is 
continuous on 
U.  If f is a 
r
C one-to-one map with a 
r
C inverse

f
−
 defined on ()fU, then f 
is called a 
r
C diffeomorphism.

By (43.13) the limit of the last term is zero as 
0τ→, and (43.15) is obtained.  Equation (43.15) 
holds for all 
∈vV because we can always choose τ in (43.16) small enough to ensure that τ+xv 
is in 
U, the domain of f.  If f is differentiable at every ∈xU, then (43.15) can be written

A function

:f→

q
f→UTV is a tensor field of order q.  It should be noted 
that the term field is defined here is not the same as that in Section 7. 
 
Before closing this section there is an important theorem which needs to be recorded for 
later use.  We shall not prove this theorem here, but we assume that the reader is familiar with the 
result known as the inverse mapping theorem in multivariable calculus. 
 
Theorem 43.7.  Let 
:'f→UE

r
C mapping and assume that 
0
grad   (    )fx is a linear 
isomorphism.  Then there exists a neighborhood

This theorem provides a condition under which one can asert the existence of a local inverse of a 
smooth mapping.

Geometrically, the Cartesian coordinate system can be represented by Figure 7 for N=3.  The 
coordinate transformation represented by (44.20) yields the result in Figure 8 (again for N=3).  
Since every inner product space has an orthonormal basis (see Theorem 13.3), there is no loss of 
generality in assuming that associated with every point of 
E
 as origin we can introduce a 
rectangular Cartesian coordinate system.

 As an example of the above ideas, consider the cylindrical coordinate system

N=3 and equations (44.23) take the special form

(, , ) ( cos , sin , )zz zxx xx x=                                        (44.25)                                        
 
In order for (44.25) to qualify as a coordinate transformation, it is necessary for the transformation 
functions to be C

Figure 9 describes the cylindrical system.  The coordinate curves are a straight line (for

), a 
circle lying in a plane parallel to the 
12
(, )zz plane (for 
2
x), and a straight line coincident with 
3
z 
(for

constx= is a circular cylinder whose generators are the

lines.  The remaining coordinate surfaces are planes.

 The computer program Maple has a plot command, coordplot3d, that is useful when trying to visualize coordinate

 Just as a vector space can be assigned an orientation, a Euclidean manifold can be oriented 
by assigning the orientation to its translation space 
V.  In this case E is called an oriented 
Euclidean manifold.  In such a manifold we use Cartesian coordinate systems associated with 
positive basis only and these coordinate systems are called positive.  A curvilinear coordinate 
system is positive if its coordinate transformation relative to a positive Cartesian coordinate system 
has a positive Jacobian.

Section 45.   Transformation Rules for Vectors and Tensor Fields 
 
In this section, we shall formalize certain ideas regarding fields on 
E
 and then investigate 
the transformation rules for vectors and tensor fields.  Let 
U be an open subset of E;  we shall 
denote by (   )F
∞
U the set of C
∞
 functions :f→UR.  First we shall study the algebraic structure 
of       (   )F
∞
U.  If 
1
f and 
2
f are in (   )F
∞
U, then their sum 
12
ff+ is an element of (   )F
∞
U defined by 
 
 
1212
()()()()ffff+=+xxx                                                (45.1)                                                
 
and their produce 
12
ff is also an element of (   )F
∞
U defined by 
 
 
1212
()()() ()ffff=xxx                                                    (45.2)                                                    
 
for all 
∈xU.  For any real number λ∈R the constant function is defined by 
 
                                                                         ()
λλ=x                                                               (45.3)                                                               
 
for all ∈
xU.  For simplicity, the function and the value in (45.3) are indicated by the same 
symbol.  Thus, the zero function in (   )F
∞
U is denoted simply by 0 and for every (   )fF
∞
∈U 
 
 0
ff+=                                                              (45.4)                                                              
 
It is also apparent that 
 
 1
ff=                                                                (45.5)                                                                
 
In addition, we define 
 
                                                                             (1)
ff−=−                                                            (45.6)                                                            
 

Sec. 45            •            Transformation Rules  325 
It is easily shown that the operations of addition and multiplication obey commutative, associative, 
and distributive laws.  These facts show that (   )F
∞
U is a commutative ring (see Section 7). 
 
An important collection of scalar fields can be constructed as follows:  Given two charts 
()
1
ˆ
,
xU
 and 
()
2
ˆ

yU
, where

As mentioned earlier, a C

 vector field on an open set U of E is a C

 map    :→vUV, 
where 
V
 is the translation space of 
E

of vector fields.  We can express

(45.22) earlier with (44.48).  Equation (44.48) shows that the

Cartesian coordinates that constant tensor fields have constant components. 
 
 Another important tensor field is the one constructed from the positive unit volume tensor

 In mathematical physics, tensor fields often arise naturally in component forms relative to 
product bases associated with several bases.  For example, if 
{}
a
e and 
{}
ˆ
b
e are fields of bases, 
possibly anholonomic, then it might be convenient to express a second-order tensor field 
A as a 
field of linear transformations such that

 In this section we shall investigate the problem of representing the gradient of various 
tensor fields in components relative to the natural basis of arbitrary coordinate systems.  We 
consider first the simple case of representing the tangent of a smooth curve in 
E.  Let 
()
:,ab→λE
 be a smooth curve passing through a point x, say (  )c=xλ.  Then the tangent vector 
of 
λ
 at 
x
 is defined by

Given the chart 
()
ˆ
,
xU covering 
x
, we can project the vector equation (47.1) into the natural basis 
{}
i
g
 of 
ˆ
x.  First, the coordinates of the curve λ are given by

for all t such that

By (47.3) this equation can be rewritten as

Thus, the components of 
λ

 relative to 
{}
j
g are simply the derivatives of the coordinate 
representations of 
λ
 in 
ˆ
x.  In fact (44.33) can be regarded as a special case of (47.3) when 
λ
 
coincides with the i
th
 coordinate curve of 
ˆ
x
. 
 
 An important consequence of (47.3) is that

In particular, if

 Next we consider the gradient of a smooth function

where

g is a natural basis vector associated with the coordinate chart as defined by (44.31).  In

The formula (47.32) is most convenient for the calculation of the Christoffel symbols in any given 
chart. 
 
 As an example, we now compute the Christoffel symbols for the cylindrical coordinate 
system in a three-dimensional space.  In Section 44 we have shown that the components of the 
metric tensor are given by (44.50) and (44.51) relative to this coordinate system.  Substituting those 
components into (47.32), we obtain

Having presented some basis properties of the Christoffel symbols, we now return to the 
general formula (47.23) for the components of the gradient of a tensor field.  Substituting (47.26)

ggδ===                                                   (47.40)                                                   
 
for all   ,  ,1,...,ilkN=. In fact, (47.40) is equivalent to (47.31), which we have used to obtain the 
formula (47.32) for the Christoffel symbols.  An important consequence of (47.40) is that the 
operations of raising and lowering of indices commute with the operation of gradient or covariant 
differentiation. 
 
            Another            constant tensor field on 
E is the tensor field E defined by (45.26).  While the sign 
of E depends on the orientation, we always have

in any coordinate system.  Thus, the operations of skew-symmetrization and covariant 
differentiation commute, provided that the indices of the covariant differentiations are not affected 
by the skew-symmetrization.

so that

This result is useful since it does not depend on the Christoffel symbols explicitly.

Sec. 48            •            Covariant Derivatives along Curves 353 
 
Section 48.   Covariant Derivatives along Curves 
 
 In the preceding section we have considered covariant differentiation of tensor fields which 
are defined on open submanifolds in 
E.  In applications, however, we often encounter vector or 
tensor fields defined only on some smooth curve in 
E.  For example, if    : (  ,  )ab→λE is a smooth 
curve, then the tangent vector 
λ

 is a vector field on E.  In this section we shall consider the 
problem of representing the gradients of arbitrary tensor fields defined on smooth curves in a 
Euclidean space. 
 
 Given any smooth curve 
:(  ,  )ab→λE
 and a field 
:(  ,  )(   )
q
ab→ATV
 we can regard the 
value 
()tA as a tensor of order q at ()tλ.  Then the gradient or covariant derivative of A along λ 
is defined by

for all 
(,)tab∈.  If the limit on the right-hand side of (48.1) exists, then ()dtdtA is itself also a 
tensor field of order 
q on λ.  Hence, we can define the second gradient 
22
()dtdtA by replacing 
A by 
()dtdtA in (48.1).  Higher gradients of A are defined similarly.  If all gradients of A 
exist, then A is 
C
∞
-smooth on λ.  We are interested in representing the gradients of A in 
component form. 
 
            Let            
ˆ
x be a coordinate system covering some point of λ.  Then as before we can 
characterize 
λ by its coordinate representation 
()

where the product basis is that of 
ˆ
x at ()tλ, the point where ()tA is defined.  Differentiating 
(48.2) with respect to t, we obtain

We leave the proof of this general formula as an exercise.  In view of the representations (48.6) and 
(48.7), we see that it is important to distinguish the notation

In particular, when

VECTOR FIELDS AND DIFFERENTIAL FORMS 
 
 
Section 49.  Lie Derivatives 
 
Let 
E
 be a Euclidean manifold and let anduvbe vector fields defined on some open set inUE.  
In Exercise 45.2 we have defined the Lie bracket 
[]
,uv by  
 
 
[]
()()
,gradgrad=−uvv uu v                                              (49.1)                                              
 
In this section first we shall explain the geometric meaning of the formula (49.1), and then we 
generalize the operation to the 
Lie derivative of arbitrary tensor fields. 
 
To interpret the operation on the right-hand side of (49.1), we start from the concept of 
the flow generated by a vector field.  We say that a curve 
()
:,ab→λUis an integral curve of a 
vector field 
v if

for all 
()
,.tab∈  By (47.1), the condition (49.2) means that λis an integral curve of v if and 
only if its tangent vector coincides with the value of 
v at every point 
()
.tλ
  An integral curve 
may be visualized as the orbit of a point flowing with velocity 
.v
  Then the flow generated by 
v
 
is defined to be the mapping that sends a point 
()
0
tλ
 to a point 
()
tλ
 along any integral curve of 
.v 
 
To make this concept more precise, let us introduce a local coordinate system 
ˆ
x
.  Then 
the condition (49.2) can be represented by

where (47.4) has been used.  This formula shows that the coordinates 
()
()

tiNλ=! of an 
integral curve are governed by a system of first-order differential equations.  Now it is proved in 
the theory of differential equations that if the fields

smooth, then corresponding to any initial condition, say

sufficiently small neighborhood of

the interval of existence of the solution.  We denote this mapping by     ,

and we call it the flow generated by 
v.  In particular,

Since the fields

characteristic property of such a system is that the flow generated by 
v forms a local one-

Consequently the gradient, grad     ,

Now the parallelism generated by the flow of

vector field

We now derive a representation for the Lie derivative in terms of a local coordinate

Consequently the Lie derivative has the following coordinate-free representation:

Sec. 49            •            Lie Derivatives  363 
 
Comparing (49.23) with (49.1), we obtain

uvuL                                                           (49.24)                                                           
 
Since the Lie derivative is defined by the limit of the difference quotient (49.13), 
v
uL
vanishes if and only if u commutes with the flow of v in the following sense: 
 
 
ti
=uρPuD                                                           (49.25)                                                           
 
When 
u satisfies this condition, it may be called invariant with respect tov.  Clearly, this 
condition is symmetric for the pair 
()
,,uv since the Lie bracket is skew-symmetric, namely 
 
 
[][]
,,=−uvvu                                                       (49.26)                                                       
 
In particular, (49.25) is equivalent to 
 
 
tt
=vQvDφ                                                          (49.27)                                                          
 
where 
t

Another condition equivalent to (49.25) and (49.27) is

that the Lie bracket of    anduv vanishes.  Thus the condition (49.28) is shown to be equivalent to 
the condition (49.30). 
 
The result just established can be used to prove the theorem mentioned in Section 46 that 
a field of basis is holonomic if and only if  
 
                                                                  ,0

So far we have considered the Lie derivative

Since the parallelism

 is a linear isomorphism, it can be extended to tensor 
fields.  As usual for simple tensors we define

which generalizes the formula (49.21).  We leave the proof of (49.42) as an exercise.  By the 
same argument as (49.22), the partial derivatives in (49.42) can be replaced by covariant 
derivatives. 
 
It should be noted that the operations of raising and lowering of indices by the Euclidean 
metric do not commute with the Lie derivative, since the parallelism 
t
P generated by the flow 
generally does not preserve the metric.  Consequently, to compute the Lie derivative of a tensor 
field     ,Awe must assign a particular contravariant order and covariant order to 
.A
  The formula 
(49.42) is valid when Ais regarded as a tensor field of contravariant order 
r and covariant order 
s. 
 
By the same token, the Lie derivative of a constant tensor such as the volume tensor or 
the skew-symmetric operator generally need not vanish.

368 Chap. 10 • VECTOR FIELDS 
 
Section 50.  The Frobenius Theorem 
 
The concept of the integral curve of a vector field has been considered in some detail in 
the preceding section.  In this section we introduce a somewhat more general concept.  If 
v is a 
non-vanishing vector field in 
,Ethen at each point 
x
in the domain of v we can define a one-
dimensional Euclidean space 
()
xD
 spanned by the vector 
()
.vx
  In this sense an integral curve 
of 
v corresponds to a one-dimensional hypersurface in 
E
 which is tangent to 
()
xD at each 
point of the hypersurface.  Clearly this situation can be generalized if we allow the field of 
Euclidean spaces 
Dto be multidimensional.  For definiteness, we call such a field D a 
distribution in 
,E say of dimension D.  Then a D-dimensional hypersurface 
L
 in 
E
 is called an 
integral surface of D if L is tangent to Dat every point of the hypersurface. 
 
Unlike a one-dimensional distribution, which corresponds to some non-vanishing vector 
field and hence always possesses many integral curves, a 
D-dimensional distribution 
D
 in 
general need not have any integral hypersurface at all.  The problem of characterizing those 
distributions that do possess integral hypersurfaces is answered precisely by the Frobenius 
theorem.  Before entering into the details of this important theorem, we introduce some 
preliminary concepts first. 
 
Let 
Dbe a D-dimensional distribution and let v be a vector field.  Then v is said to be 
contained in D if 
()  ()
∈vxxD at each 
x
 in the domain of v.  Since D is D-dimensional, there 
exist 
D vector fields 
{}
,1,,D
α
α=v!
contained in Dsuch that 
()
xD
 is spanned by 
()
{}
,1,,D
α
α=vx!at each point x in the domain of the vector fields.  We call 
{}
,1,,D
α
α=v!
a local basis for D.  We say that D is smooth at some point 
0
x if there exists a 
local basis defined on a neighborhood of 
0
x formed by smooth vector fields 
α
v contained in D.  
Naturally, 
D
 is said to be smooth if it is smooth at each point of its domain.  We shall be 
interested in 
smooth distributions only. 
 
We say that 
D
 is integrable at a point 
0
x if there exists a local coordinate system 
ˆ
x 
defined on a neighborhood of 
0
x such that the vector fields 
{}
,1,,D
α
α=g!
 form a local basis 
for 
D
.  Equivalently, this condition means that the hypersurfaces characterized by the conditions

are integral hypersurfaces of 
D
.  Since the natural basis vectors 
i
g of any coordinate system are 
smooth, by the very definition 
D
must be smooth at 
0
xif it is integrable there.  Naturally, 
D
 is 
said to be 
integrable if it is integrable at each point of its domain.  Consequently, every 
integrable distribution must be smooth. 
 

Sec. 50            •            The Frobenius Theorem 369 
Now we are ready to state and prove the Frobenius theorem, which characterizes 
integrable distributions. 
 
Theorem 50.1.  A smooth distribution D is integrable if and only if it is closed with respect to 
the Lie bracket, i.e.,

since they correspond to linear combinations of volume tensors on various hypersurfaces (cf. the 
book by Flanders
1
).  For our purpose, however, we shall consider only some elementary results 
about differential forms.

We define first the notion of the exterior derivative of a differential form.  Let Abe the r-
form
 represented by (51.2) or (51.4).  Then the exterior derivative dAis an

by any one of the following three equivalent formulas:

Comparing this representation with (47.52), we see that the exterior derivative and the curl 
operator are related by

for any 1-form 
.u Equation (51.13) also follows from (51.6) and (47.50).  In the sense of (51.13)
, the exterior derivative is a generalization of the curl operator from 1-forms to 
r-forms in 
general.  We shall now consider some basic properties of the exterior derivative. 
 
I.
 If f is a smooth function (i.e., a  0-form), then the exterior derivative of f coincides 
with the gradient of 
f, 
 
                                                                               grad
dff=                                                          (51.14)                                                          
 
This result follows readily from (51.5) and (47.14). 
II.
 If w is a smooth covariant vector field (i.e., a 1-form), and if u and v are smooth 
vector fields, then

We leave the proof of (51.30), by direct calculation based on the representations (51.5) and 
(49.42), as an exercise. 
 
The results I-VII summarized above are the basic properties of the exterior derivative.  In 
fact, results I and III-V characterize the exterior derivative completely.  This converse assertion 
can be stated formally in the following way. 
 
Coordinate-free definition of the exterior derivative.  The exterior derivative d is an operator 
from an 
r-form to an 
()
1formr+−
and satisfies the conditions, I, III-V above. 
 

Sec. 51            •            Differential Forms, Exterior Derivative 379 
To see that this definition is equivalent to the representations (51.5), we consider any 
r-
form 
Agiven by the representation (51.4)

.  Applying the operator d to both sides of that 
representation and making use of conditions I and III-V, we get

Section 52.  The Dual Form of the Frobenius Theorem; the Poincaré Lemma 
 
The Frobenius theorem as stated and proved in Section 50 characterizes the integrability 
of a distribution by a condition on the Lie bracket of the generators of the distribution.  In this 
section we shall characterize the same by a condition on the exterior derivative of the generators 
of the orthogonal complement of the distribution. This condition constitutes the dual form of the 
Frobenius theorem. 
 
As in Section 50, let 
D be a distribution of dimension D defined on a domain in   .UE 
Then at each point 
∈xU,    (  )xD is a D-dimensional subspace of V.  We put 
()
⊥
xD
 to be the 
orthogonal complement of 
()
xD.  Then 
()

this way is itself a distribution of dimension .

Proof.  As in Section 50, let

By the Frobenius theorem 
D is integrable if and only if (50.5) holds.  Substituting (50.5) and 
(52.2) into (51.15) with

We now show that this condition is equivalent to (52.1). 
 
To prove the said equivalence, we extend

which is clearly equivalent to (52.1). 
 
As an example of the integrability condition (52.1), we can derive a necessary and 
sufficient condition for a vector field 
z
 to be orthogonal to a family of surfaces.  That is, there 
exist smooth functions 
h and f such that  
 
                                                                               grad
hf=z                                                            (52.6)                                                            
 
Such a vector field is called 
complex-lamellar in the classical theory.  Using the terminology 
here, we see that a complex-lamellar vector field 
z
 is a vector field such that 
⊥
z is integrable. 
Hence by (52.1), z is complex-lamellar if and only if 
.d∧=zz0
  In a three-dimensional space 
this condition can be written as 
 
 
()
curl0⋅=zz
                                                           (52.7)                                                           
 
which was first noted by Kelvin (1851).  In component form, if 
z is represented by

zzdx==zg                                                          (52.8)

Sec. 52            •            Dural Form of Frobenius Theorem; Poincaré Lemma 383 
 
which is equivalent to the component version of (52.7).  In view of this special case we see that 
the dual form of the Frobenius theorem is a generalization of Kelvin’s condition from 1-forms to 
r-forms in general. 
 
In the classical theory a vector field (1-form) z is called 
lamellar if locally z is the gradient 
of a smooth function (0-form) 
f, namely 
 
                                                                          grad
fdf==z                                                       (52.13)                                                       
 
Then it can be shown that 
z
 is lamellar if and only if dz vanishes, i.e., 
 
                                                                        curl
=z0                                                            (52.14)                                                            
 
The generalization of lamellar fields from 1-forms to 
r-forms in general is obvious: We say that 
an 
r-form 
A
 is closed if its exterior derivative vanishes 
 
 
d=0A                                                              (52.15)                                                              
 
and we say that 
A is exact if it is the exterior derivatives of an (r-1)-form, say 
 
 
d=AB                                                              (52.16)                                                              
 
From (51.24) any exact form is necessarily closed.  The theorem that generalizes the classical 
result is the Poincaré lemma, which implies that (52.16) and (52.15) are locally equivalent. 
 
Before stating the Poincaré lemma, we defined first the notion of a 
star-shaped (or 
retractable) open set U in E: U is star-shaped if there exists a smooth mapping 
 
 :
×→ρUR   U                                                        (52.17)

where 
0
x is a particular point in 
.U
  In a star-shaped open set 
U
 all closed hypersurfaces of 
dimensions 1 to 
1N− are retractable in the usual sense.  For example, an open ball is star-
shaped but the open set between two concentric spheres is not, since a closed sphere in the latter 
is not retractable. 
 

384 Chap. 10 • VECTOR FIELDS 
The equivalence of (52.13) and (52.14) requires only that the domain U of 
z
 be simply 
connected, i.e., every closed curve in 
U
 be retractable.  When we generalize the result to the 
equivalence of (52.15) and (52.16), the domain 
U of A must be retractable relative to all r-
dimensional closed hypersurfaces.  For simplicity, we shall assume that 
U is star-shaped. 
 
Theorem 52.2.  If 
A
 is a closed r-form defined on a star-shaped domain, then 
A
is exact, i.e., 
there exists an (r-1)-form 
B on 
U
 such that (52.16) holds.

Section 53.   Vector Fields in a Three-Dimensional Euclidean Manifold, I.  
Invariants and Intrinsic Equations
 
 
The preceding four sections of this chapter concern vector fields, distributions, and 
differential forms, defined on domains in an N-dimensional Euclidean manifold 
Ein general.  In 
applications, of course, the most important case is when 
E
 is three-dimensional.  Indeed, 
classical vector analysis was developed just for this special case.  In this section we shall review 
some of the most important results in the classical theory from the more modern point of view, as 
we have developed so far in this text. 
 
We recall first that when 
Eis three-dimensional the exterior product may be replaced by 
the cross product [cf.(41.19)].  Specially, relative to a positive orthonormal basis 
{}

are the usual component representations of     anduvand where the reciprocal basis 
{}
i
ecoincides 
with 
{}
i
e.  It is important to note that the representation (53.1) is valid relative to a positive 
orthonormal basis only; if the orthonormal basis 
{}
i
e is negative, the signs on the right-hand side 
of (53.1) must be reversed.  For this reason, 
×uv is called an axial vector in the classical theory. 
 
We recall also that when 
E is three-dimensional, then the curl of a vector field can be 
represented by a vector field [cf. (47.53) or (51.34)].  Again, if a positive rectangular Cartesian 
coordinate system

By the same remark as before, 
curlv is an axial vector field, so the signs on the right-hand side 
must be reversed when 
()
i
x is negative. 
 
Now consider a nonvanishing smooth vector field 
.v  We put 
 
 
/=svv
                                                             (53.6)                                                             
 
Then 
s is a unit vector field in the same direction as .v  In Section 49 we have introduced the 
notions of internal curves and flows corresponding to any smooth vector field.  We now apply 
these to the vector field 
.s  Sinces is a unit vector, its integral curves are parameterized by the 
arc length

 s.  A typical integral curve of s is

s=λλ                                                               (53.7)                                                               
 
where

but generally 
/ddsλ is not equal to 
()
()
,svλ so λ is not an integral curve of v as defined in 
Section 49.  In the classical theory the locus of 
λ without any particular parameterization is 
called a vector line of  
.v 
 
Now assuming that 
λ is not a straight line, i.e., s is not invariant on λ, we can take the 
covariant derivative of 
s on λ(cf. Section 48 and write the result in the form

It should be noted that (53.10) defines both 
κ and n: κ is the norm of /ddssand nis the unit 
vector in the direction of the nonvanishing vector field 
/ddss.  The reciprocal of    ,κ 
 
 
1/rκ=                                                             (53.12)                                                             
 
is called the 
radius of curvature of λ.

or, equivalently, 
 
 
0⋅=sn                                                              (53.14)                                                              
 
Thus 
n is normal to
s
, as it should be.  In view of (53.14) the cross product of    withsn is a unit 
vector 
 
 
≡×bsn                                                             (53.15)                                                             
 
which is called the 
binormal of λ.  The triad 
{}
,,snb now forms a field of positive orthonormal 
basis in the domain of 
.v  In general 
{}
,,snb is anholonomic, of course. 
 
Now we compute the covariant derivative of

unit vector, by the same argument as (53.13) we have

Similarly, since 0,

The results (53.10), (53.18), and (53.20) are the 
Serret-Frenet formulas for the curveλ. 
 
So far we have introduced a field of basis 
{}
,,snb associated with the nonzero and 
nonrectilinear vector field 
.v Moreover, the Serret-Frenet formulas give the covariant derivative 
of the basis along the vector lines of 
v.  In order to make full use of the basis, however, we need 
a complete representation of the covariant derivative of that basis along all curves.  Then we can 
express the gradient of the vector fields   ,   ,
snb in component forms relative to the anholonomic 
basis

,,snb.  These components play the same role as the Christoffel symbols for a holonomic 
basis.  The component forms of  grad

Notice that (53.21) implies that 
 
 
curl0⋅=ns
                                                          (53.26)                                                          
 
but the remaining eight components in (53.21) are generally nonzero. 
 
Next Bjørgum shows that the components of the second-order tensor fields 
grads, 
gradn, and  gradb relative to the basis 
{}

These representations are clearly consistent with the representations (53.21) through the general 
formula (47.53).  Further, from (48.15) the covariant derivatives of   ,   , andsnb along the integral 
curve    ofλs are

Since the basis

,,snb is anholonomic in general, the parameters

,,snb are not local 
coordinates.  In particular, the differential operators 
/,/ ,/ddsddnddb do not commute.  We 
derive first the commutation formulas

 for a scalar function f.

Having obtained the representations (53.21) and (53.27), the commutation rules (53.33), 
and the intrinsic equations (53.35) for the basis

,,snb, we can now return to the original 
relations (53.6) and derive various representations for the invariants of 
.v For brevity, we shall 
now denote the norm of

υ=vs                                                               (53.36)

Representations for Special Classes of Vector Fields
 
 
In Section 52 we have proved the Poincaré lemma, which asserts that, locally, a 
differential form is exact if and only if it is closed.  This result means that we have the local 
representation 
 
 
d=fg                                                                 (54.1)                                                                 
 
for any 
f
 such that 
 
0d=f                                                                 (54.2)                                                                 
 
In a three-dimensional Euclidean manifold the local representation (54.1) has the following two 
special cases. 
(i) Lamellar Fields 
 
 
gradf=v                                                             (54.3)                                                             
 
is a local representation for any vector field 
v such that 
 
                                                                        curl0
=v                                                              (54.4)                                                              
 
Such a vector field 
v is called a lamellar field in the classical theory, and the scalar function f is 
called the 
potential of v.  Clearly, the potential is locally unique to within an arbitrary additive 
constant. 
(ii) Solenoidal Fields 
 
 
curl=vu                                                              (54.5)                                                              
 
is a local representation for any vector field 
v such that 
 
                                                                         div0
=v                                                               (54.6)                                                               
 
Such a vector field 
v is called a solenoidal field in the classical theory, and the vector field u is 
called the 
vector potential of v.  The vector potential is locally unique to within an arbitrary 
additive lamellar field. 
 
In the representation (54.3), 
f is regarded as a 0-form and v is regarded as a 1-form, 
while in the representation (54.5), 
u is regarded as a 1-form and v is regarded as the dual of a 2-
form; duality being defined by the canonical positive unit volume tensor of the 3-dimensional 
Euclidean manifold 
.E
 

400 Chap. 10 • VECTOR FIELDS 
 
In Section 52 we remarked also that the dual form of the Frobenius theorem implies the 
following representation. 
 (
iii) Complex-Lamellar Fields 
 
                                                                               grad
hf=v                                                            (54.7)                                                            
 
is a local representation for any vector field 
v such that  
 
                                                                           curl0
⋅=vv                                                            (54.8)                                                            
 
Such a vector field 
v is called complex-lamellar in the classical theory.  In the representation 
(54.7) the surfaces defined by 
 
 
()
constf=x
                                                           (54.9)                                                           
 
are orthogonal to the vector field 
v. 
 
We shall now derive some other well-known representations in the classical theory. 
 
A. Euler’s Representation for Solenoidal Fields 
 
Every solenoidal vector field 
v may be represented locally by 
 
 
()()
gradgradhf=×v                                                  (54.10)                                                  
 
Proof.  We claim that v has a particular vector potential 
ˆ
u
 which is complex-lamellar.  From the 
remark on (54.5), we may choose 
ˆ
u by 
 
 
ˆ
grad
k=+uu                                                         (54.11)                                                         
 
where 
u is any vector potential of v.  In order for 
ˆ
u
 to be complex-lamellar, it must satisfy the 
condition (54.8), i.e.,

Clearly, this equation possesses infinitely many solutions for the scalar function 
k, since it is a 
first-order partial differential equation with smooth coefficients.  Hence by the representation 
(54.7) we may write

Taking the curl of this equation, we obtain the Euler representation (54.10):

                              (54.14)                              
 
It should be noted that in the Euler representation (54.10) the vector 
v is orthogonal to 
grad
has well as to  gradf, namely  
 
                                                                 gradgrad0

Consequently, 
v is tangent to the surfaces 
 
 
()
consth=x                                                         (54.16)                                                         
or

constf=x                                                         (54.17)                                                         
 
For this reason, these surfaces are then called 
vector sheets of v.  If ,≠v0 then from (54.10), 
grad
hand  gradfare not parallel, so that h and f are functionally independent.  In this case the 
intersections of the surfaces (54.16) and (54.17) are the vector lines of
 .v 
 
Euler’s representation for solenoidal fields implies the following results. 
 
B. Monge’s Representation for Arbitrary Smooth Vector Fields 
 
Every smooth vector field 
v may be represented locally by 
 
                                                                     gradgrad
hkf=+v                                                   (54.18)                                                   
 
where the scalar functions, 
h, k, f are called the Monge potentials (not unique) of v. 
 
Proof.  Since (54.10) is a representation for any solenoidal vector field, from (54.5) we can write 
curlv as  
 
 
()()
curlgradgradkf=×v                                              (54.19)                                              
 
It follows that (54.19) that 
 
 
()
curlgrad0kf−=v                                                  (54.20)                                                  

402 Chap. 10 • VECTOR FIELDS 
 
Thus           grad
kf−v is a lamellar vector field.  From (54.3) we then we have the local 
representation 
 
                                                                        gradgrad
kf   h−=v                                                   (54.21)                                                   
 
which is equivalent to (54.18). 
 
Next we prove another well-known representation for arbitrary smooth vector fields in 
the classical theory. 
 
C. Stokes’ Representation for Arbitrary Smooth Vector Fields  
 
Every smooth vector field v may be represented locally by 
 
                                                                       gradcurl
h=+vu                                                     (54.22)                                                     
 
where     and
hu are called the Stokes potential (not unique) of v. 
 
Proof.  We show that there exists a scalar function h such that gradh−v is solenoidal.  
Equivalently, this condition means 
 
 
()
divgrad0h−=v                                                    (54.23)                                                    
 
Expanding (54.23), we get 
 
 
divhΔ=v                                                           (54.24)                                                           
 
where Δ denotes the Laplacian [cf. (47.49)]. Thus 
h satisfies the Poisson equation (54.24).  It is 
well known that, locally, there exist infinitely many solutions (54.24).  Hence the representation 
(54.22) is valid. 
 
Notice that, from (54.19), Stokes’ representation (54.22) also can be put in the form 
 
 
()()
gradgradgradhk  f=+ ×v                                           (54.25)                                           
 
Next we consider the intrinsic conditions for the various special classes of vector fields.  
First, from (53.40)
2
 a vector field v is solenoidal if and only if 
 
                                                         /div
ddsυυ=−s                                                     (54.26)                                                     
 

Sec. 54            •            Three-Dimensional Euclidean Manifold, II 403 
where   ,   , and
sυs are defined in the preceding section.  Integrating (54.26) along any vector line

  Thus

 in a solenoidal vector field v 
the vector magnitude is determined to within a constant factor along any vector line 
()
s=λλ by 
the vector line pattern of 
v. 
 
From (53.40)
4
, a vector field v is complex-lamellar if and only if  
 
 0
s
υΩ=                                                             (54.28)                                                             
or, equivalently,

since in the intrinsic representation 
v is assumed to be nonvanishing.  The result (54.29) is 
entirely obvious, because it defines the unit vector field   ,
s parallel to    ,v to be complex-lamellar. 
 
From (53.40)
4
 again, a vector field v is lamellar if and only if, in addition to (54.28) or 
(54.29), we have also  
 
                                                    /0,/

It should be noted that, when 
v is lamellar, it can be represented by (54.3), and thus the potential 
surfaces defined by

Finally, in the classical theory a vector field 
v is called a screw field or a Beltrami field if 
v is parallel to its curl, namely 
 
 
curl×=vv0                                                         (54.34)                                                         
 
or, equivalently, 
 
                                                                      curl
s
=Ωvv                                                          (54.35)                                                          
 
where 
s
Ω is the abnormality of   ,s defined by (53.22)
1
.  In some sense a screw field is just the 
opposite of a complex-lamellar field, which is defined by the condition that the vector field is 
orthogonal to its curl [cf. (54.8)].  Unfortunately, there is no known simple direct representation 
for screw fields.  We must refer the reader to the three long articles by Bjørgum and Godal (see 
footnote 1 above and footnotes 4 and 5 below), which are devoted entirely to the study of these 
fields. 
 
We can, of course, use some general representations for arbitrary smooth vector fields, 
such as Monge’s representation or Stokes’ representation, to express a screw field first.  Then we 
impose some additional restrictions on the scalar fields involved in the said representations.  For 
example, if we use Monge’s representation (54.18) for 
v, then curl v is given by (54.19).  In 
this case 
v is a screw field if and only if the constant potential surfaces of     andkf are vector 
sheets of 
v, i.e., 
 
 
gradgrad0kf⋅=⋅    =vv                                                (54.36)                                                
 
From (53.40)
4
 the intrinsic conditions for a screw field are easily fround to be simply the 
conditions (54.30).  So the integrals (54.32) and (54.33) remain valid in this case, along the 
lines−band the lines.−n  When the abnormality 
s
Ω is nonvanishing, the integral of υ along 
any 
line−scan be found in the following way:  From (53.40) we have 
 
                                                          /div div
ddsυυ=−vs                                                 (54.37)                                                 
 
Now from the basic conditions (54.35) for a screw field we obtain

since 
υ
 is nonvanishing.  From (54.43), (54.33), and (54.32) we see that the magnitude of a 
screw field, except for a constant factor, is determined along any 
line,line, or line−−−snb by 
the vector line pattern of the field.

A screw field whose curl is also a screw field is called a Trkalian field.  According to a 
theorem of Mémenyi and Prim (1949), a screw field is a Trkalian field if and only if its 
abnormality is a constant.  Further, all Trkalian fields are solenoidal and successive curls of the 
field are screw fields, all having the same abnormality.

The proof of this theorem may be found also in Bjørgum’s article.  Trkalian fields are 
considered in detail in the subsequent articles of Bjørgum and Godal

HYPERSURFACES ON A EUCLIDEAN MANIFOLD 
 
 
In this chapter we consider the theory of (N-1)-dimensional hypersurfaces embedded in an N-
dimensional Euclidean manifold 
E.  We shall not treat hypersurfaces of dimension less than N-
1, although many results of this chapter can be generalized to results valid for those 
hypersurfaces also.

characterized locally by an equation

The local representation (55.1) of 
S is not unique, or course.  Indeed, if f satisfies (55.1), 
so does –f, the induced unit normal of –f  being –
n.  If the hypersurface S can be represented 
globally by (55.1), i.e., there exists a smooth function whose domain contains the entire 
hypersurface such that 
 
                                                                                 ()  0f

then S
 is called orientable.  In this case S can be equipped with a smooth global unit normal 
field 
n.  (Of course, -n is also a smooth global unit normal field.)  We say that S is oriented if a 
particular smooth global unit normal field

There is a fundamental difference between the surface metric 
a on S and the Euclidean 
metric 
g on E however.  In the Euclidean space E there exist coordinate systems in which the 
components of 
g are constant.  Indeed, if the coordinate system is a rectangular Cartesian one, 
then 
ij
gis 
ij
δat all points of the domain of the coordinate system.  On the hypersurface S, 
generally, there need not be any coordinate system in which the components 
a
ΓΔ
or 
a
ΓΔ
 are 
constant unless 
S happens to be a hyperplane.  As we shall see in a later section, the departure 
of 
a
 from g in this regard can be characterized by the curvature of S. 
 
Another important difference between Sand Eis the fact that in Sthe tangent planes at 
different points generally are different (
N-1)-dimensional subspaces of 
V
.  Hence a vector in 
V
 
may be tangent to 
S at one point but not at another point.  For this reason there is no canonical 
parallelism which connects the tangent planes of 
Sat distinct points.  As a result, the notions of 
gradient or covariant derivative of a tangential vector or tensor field on 
S
 must be carefully 
defined, as we shall do in the next section. 
 
The notions of Lie derivative and exterior derivative introduced in Sections 49 and 51, 
however, can be readily defined for tangential fields of 
S.  We consider first the Lie derivative. 
 
Let 
v
 be a smooth tangent field defined on a domain in S.  Then as before we say that a 
smooth curve ( )
t=λλ in the domain of v is an integral curve if 
 
 
()/( ())dt dtt=λvλ                                                     (55.28)                                                     
 
at all points of the curve.  If we represent 
λand v in component forms

Hence integral curves exist for any smooth tangential vector field 
v and they generate flow, and 
hence a parallelism, along any integral curve.  By the same argument as in Section 49, we define 
the Lie derivative of a smooth tangential vector field 
u relative to v by the limit (49.14), except 
that now 
t
ρand 
t
Pare the flow and the parallelism in 
S
.  Following exactly the same derivation 
as before, we then obtain

which generalizes (51.5). However, since the surface covariant derivative 
∇A has not yet been 
defined, we cannot write down the equation that generalizes (51.6) to the surface exterior 
derivative.  But we shall achieve this generalization in the next section.  Other than this 
exception, all results of Sections 49-52 can now be generalized and restated in an obvious way 
for tangential fields on the hypersurface.  In fact, those results are valid for differentiable 
manifolds in general, so that they can be applied to Euclidean manifolds as well as to 
hypersurfaces therein.

Section 56.  Surface Covariant Derivatives 
 
As mentioned in the preceding section, the tangent planes at different points of a 
hypersurface generally do not coincide as subspaces of the translation space 
V of E. Consequently, 
it is no longer possible to define the gradient or covariant derivative of a tangential tensor field 
by a condition that formally generalizes (47.17). However, we shall see that it is possible to 
define a type of differentiation which makes (47.17) formally unchanged. For a tangential tensor 
field 
A represented by (55.26) we define the surface gradient ∇Aby

we can verify that (56.13) is valid.  Thus 
∇A

The surface covariant derivative 
∇A just defined is not the same as the covariant

A here is contained in the hypersurface

“Cartesian” coordinate systems.  Other than these two points the formulas for the surface 
covariant derivative are formally the same as those for the covariant derivative on 
E. 
 
 In view of (56.3) and (56.10), we see that the surface covariant derivative and the surface

As a result, the skew-symmetric operator as well as the operators of raising and lowering of 
indices for tangential fields both commute with the surface covariant derivative. 
 
In Section 48 we have defined the covariant derivative along a smooth curve 
λin E.  
That concept can be generalized to the surface covariant derivative along a smooth curve 
λ in 
S.  Specifically, let

Sec. 56            •          Surface Covariant Derivatives 423 
 
The coordinate-free definitions (56.34) and (56.40) demonstrate clearly the main 
difference between the surface covariant derivative on 
S and the ordinary covariant derivative 
on the Euclidean manifold 
E
.  Specifically, in the former case the parallelism used to compute 
the difference quotient is the path-dependent surface parallelism, while in the latter case the 
parallelism is simply the Euclidean parallelism, which is path-independent between any pair of 
points in 
E. 
 
In classical differential geometry the surface parallelismρ, or more generally P, defined 
by the equation (56.28) or (56.39) is known as the 
Levi-Civita parallelism or the Riemannian 
parallelism.  
This parallelism is generally path-dependent and is determined completely by the 
surface Christoffel symbols.

on 
S.  If we consider all smooth curves 
λ
in S joining the fixed end points x and y, then the 
ones satisfying the geodesic equations are curves whose arc length integral is an extremum in the 
class of variations of curves. 
 
To prove this, we observe first that the arc length integral is invariant under any change 
of parameter along the curve.  This condition is only natural, since the arc length is a geometric 
property of the point set that constitutes the curve, independent of how that point set is 
parameterized.  From (57.1) it is obvious that the tangent vector of a geodesic must have constant 
norm, since

The preceding result in the calculus of variations shows only that a geodesic is a curve 
whose arc length is an extremum in a class of variations of curves.  In terms of a fixed surface 
coordinate system

From (57.15) the curves

for all choice of

satisfying (57.15).  We note that (57.17) allows 0α=to be a local minimum, 
a local maximum, or a local minimax point in the class of variations.  In order for the arc length 
integral to be a local minimum, additional conditions must be imposed on the geodesic. 
 
It can be shown, however, that in a sufficient small surface neighborhood 
0
x
N of any 
point 
0
x in S every geodesic is, in fact, a curve of minimum arc length.  We shall omit the 
proof of this result since it is not simple.  A consequence of this result is that between any pair of 
points 
x and y in the surface neighborhood 
0

Nthere exists one and only one geodesic λ(aside

In the sense of (57.21) we say that the exponential map 
0
exp
x
is smooth. 
 
Smoothness of the exponential map can be visualized also from a slightly different point 
of view. Since 
0
x

S
, which is contained in 
E
, 
0
exp
x
can be regarded also as a 
mapping from a domain

Sec. 57            •          Surface Geodesics, Exponential Map 429 
Now the smoothness of 
0
exp
x
 has the usual meaning as defined in Section 43.  Since the surface 
coordinates 
()
y
Γ
can be extended to a local coordinate system 
()
,yf
Γ
as explained in Section 
55, smoothness in the sense of (57.21) is consistant with that of (57.23). 
 
As explained in Section 43, the smooth mapping 
0
exp
x
has a gradient at any point v in the 
domain

An important property of a canonical surface coordinate system at

corresponding surface Christoffel symbols are all equal to zero at

Section 58.  Surface Curvature, I. The Formulas of Weingarten and Gauss 
 
In the preceding sections we have considered the surface covariant derivative at 
tangential vector and tensor fields on 
S
.  We have pointed out that this covariant derivative is 
defined relative to a particular path-dependent parallelism on
S, namely the parallelism of Levi-
Civita as defined by (56.28) and (56.39).  We have remarked repeatedly that this parallelism is 
not the same as the Euclidean parallelism on the underlying space 
E in which S is embedded.  
Now a tangential tensor on 
S
, or course, is also a tensor over 
E
 being merely a tensor having 
nonzero components only in the product basis of 
{}
Γ
h
, which can be regarded as a subset of the 
basis 
{}
,
Γ
hnfor 
V
.  Consequently, the spatial covariant derivative of a tangential tensor field 
along a curve in 
S is defined.  Similarly, the special covariant derivative of the unit normal n of 
S
 along a curve in 
S
 is also defined.  We shall study these spatial covariant derivatives in this 
section. 
 
In classical differential geometry the spatial covariant derivative of a tangential field is a 
special case of the 
total covariant derivative, which we shall consider in detail later.  Since the 
spatial covariant derivative and the surface covariant derivative along a surface curve often 
appear in the same equation, we use the notion 
ddtfor the former and DDtfor the latter.  
However, when the curve is the coordinate curve of
y
Γ
, we shall write the covariant derivative as 
y
Γ
∂∂andDDy
Γ
, respectively.  It should be noted also that ddtis defined for all tensor fields 
on
λ, whether or not the field is tangential, while DDtis defined only for tangential fields. 
 
We consider first the covariant derivative 
ddtnof the unit normal field of 
S
 on any 
curve
∈λS
.  Since n is a unit vector field and since ddt preserves the spatial metric on S, we 
have 
 
 
0ddt⋅=nn                                                            (58.1)                                                            
 
Thus 
ddtnis a tangential vector field.  We claim that there exists a symmetric second-order 
tangential tensor field 
B on 
S
 such that 
 
 
ddt=−nBλ

                                                           (58.2)                                                           
 
for all surface curves 
λ.  The proof of (58.2) is more or less obvious.  From (55.2), the unit 
normal 
n on S is parallel to the gradient of a certain smooth function f, and locally S can be 
characterized by (55.1).  By normalizing the function 
f to a function

Now for the smooth vector field 
gradw we can apply the usual formula (48.15) to compute the 
spatial covariant derivative 
()( )

 along any smooth curve in E.  In particular, along 
the surface curve 
λ under consideration we have the formula (58.2), where

As a result, 
B is symmetric.  The fact that B is a tangential tensor has been remarked after 
(58.1). 
 
From (58.2) the surface tensor 
B characterizes the spatial change of the unit normal n of 
S
.  
Hence in some sense 
B is a measurement of the curvature of S in E.  In classical differential 
geometry, 
B is called the second fundamental form of S,   the surface metric a defined by 
(55.18) being the 
first fundamental form.  In component form relative to a surface coordinate

Comparing this result with the classical notions of curvature and principal normal of a curve (cf. 
Section 53), we see that the surface normal is the principal normal of a surface curve 
λ if and 
only if 
λis a surface geodesic; further, in this case the curvature of λis the quadratic form

 of B in the direction of the unit tangent s of λ.

which is called Meunier’s equation. 
 
At this point we can define another kind of covariant derivative for tensor fields on 
S.  
As we have remarked before, the tangent plane 
x
S of S is a subspace of V.  Hence a tangential 
vector 
v can be regarded either as a surface vector in 
x
Sor as a special vector in V.  In the 
former sense it is natural to use the surface covariant derivative
DDtv, while in the latter sense 
we may consider the spatial covariant derivative 
ddtvalong any smooth curve λin S.  For a 
tangential tensor field 
A, such as the one represented (56.20) or (56.22), we may choose to 
recognize certain indices as spatial indices and the remaining ones as surface indices.  In this 

Sec. 58            •          Surface Curvature, I    439 
case it becomes possible to define a covariant derivative tha is a mixture of 
ddtandDDt.  In 
classical differential geometry this new kind of covariant derivative is called the total covariant 
derivative. 
 
More specifically, we first consider a concrete example to explain this concept.  By 
definition, the surface metric tensor 
a is a constant tangential tensor relative to the surface 
covariant derivative.  In terms of any surface coordinate system

Since a mixture of 
ddtand DDtis used in definingtδδ, it is important to recognize the 
“spatial” or “surface” designation of the indices of the components of a tensor before the total 
covariant derivative is computed.  
 
In classical differential geometry the indices are distinguished directly in the notation of 
the components. Thus a tensor

Section 59.  Surface Curvature, II. The Riemann-Christoffel Tensor and the Ricci 
Identities 
 
In the preceding section we have considered the curvature of 
S
 by examining the change 
of the unit normal 
n of S in E.  This approach is natural for a hypersurface, since the metric on 
S is induced by that of E.  The results of this approach, however, are not entirely intrinsic to 
S
, since they depend not only on the surface metric but also on the particular imbedding of 
S
 
into 
E.  In this section, we shall consider curvature from a more intrinsic point of view.  We 
seek results which depend only on the surface metric.  Our basic idea is that curvature on 
S 
corresponds to the departure of the Levi-Civita parallelism on 
S
 from a Euclidean parallelism. 
 
We recall that relative to a Cartesian coordinate system 
ˆ
xon E  the covariant derivative 
of a vector field 
v has the simplest representation

Hence if we take the second covariant derivatives, then in the same coordinate system we have

In particular, the second covariant derivatives satisfy the same symmetry condition as that of the 
ordinary partial derivatives: 
 
 
,,
ii
jkkj
υυ=                                                             (59.3)                                                             
 
Note that the proof of (59.3) depends crucially on the existence of a Cartesian coordinate 
system relative to which the Christoffel symbols of the Euclidean parallelism vanish identically.  
For the hypersurface 
S in general, the geodesic coordinate system at a reference point is the 
closest counterpart of a Cartesian system.  However, in a geodesic coordinate system the surface 
Christoffel symbols vanish at the reference point only.  As a result the surface covariant 
derivative at the reference point

[cf. (57.40)].  But generally, in the same coordinate system, the representation (59.4)(59.4) does 
not hold any neighboring point of 
0
x.  This situation has been explained in detail in Section 57. 

444                                                           Chap.                                                           11                                                           •                                                           HYPERSURFACES 
In particular, there is no counterpart for the representation (59.2)
2
on S.  Indeed the surface 
second covariant derivatives generally fail to satisfy the symmetry condition (59.3) valid for the 
spatial covariant derivatives.

In a certain sense the Riemann-Christoffel tensor 
R
 characterizes locally the departure of 
the Levi-Civita parallelism from a Euclidean one.  We have the following result.

Thus the theorem is proved. 
 
It should be noted that tangential vector fields satisfying (59.13) are parallel fields 
relative to the Levi-Civita parallelism, since from (56.24) we have the representation

along any curve 
.λ  Consequently, the Levi-Civita parallelism becomes locally path-
independent.  For definiteness, we call this a locally Euclidean parallelism or a flat parallelism.  
Then the preceding theorem asserts that the Levi-Civita parallelism on 
S is locally Euclidean if 
and only if the Riemann-Christoffel tensor 
R based on the surface metric vanishes. 
 
The commutation rule (59.9) is valid for tangential vector fields only.  However, we can 
easily generalize that rule to the following Ricci identities:

In classical differential geometry a surface 
S is called developable if its Riemann-
Christoffel curvature tensore vanishes identically.

In the preceding two sections we have considered the curvature of 
S from both the 
extrinsic point of view and the intrinsic point of view.  In this section we shall unite the results of 
these two approaches.

The importance of the equations of Gauss and Codazzi lies not only in their uniting the

S in E,

While the equations of Gauss show that the Riemann Christoffel tensor 
R of S is 
completely determined by the second fundamental form 
,B the converse is generally not true.  
Thus mathematically the extrinsic characterization of curvature is much stronger than the 
intrinsic one, as it should be.  In particular, if 
B vanishes, then S reduces to a hyperplane which 
is trivially developable so that 
R
 vanishes.  On the other hand, if 
R
 vanishes, then S can be 
developed into a hyperplane, but generally 
B does not vanish, so 
S
 need not itself be a 
hyperplane.  For example, in a three-dimensional Euclidean space a cylinder is developable, but 
it is not a plane.

We shall consider the theory of integration relative to 
σin detail in Chapter 13.  Here we 
shall note only a particular result wich connects a property of the surface area to the mean 
curvature of 
S.  Namely, we seek a geometric condition for S to be a minimal surface, which 
is defined by the condition that the surface area 
()
σU be an extremum in the class of variations 
of hypersurfaces having the same boundary as    .
U  The concept of minimal surface is similar to 
that of a geodesic whichwe have explored in Section 57, except that here we are interested in the 
variation of the integral 
σ given by (61.3) instead of the integral s given by (57.5). 
 
As before, the geometric condition for a minimal surface follows from the Euler-
Lagrange equation for (61.3), namely,

In this section we shall apply the general theory of hypersurfaces to the special case of a 
two-dimensional surface imbedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean manifold.  This special case

general results.

For example, the principal basis vectors 
()()
1020
andcxc x are conjugate since the components 
of B form a diagonal matrix relative to 
{}
Γ
c
.  Geometrically, conjugate directions may be 
explained in the following way:  We choose any curve 
()
t∈λS such that  
 
 
()
o
0=∈
x
λu

S                                                        (62.18)                                                        
 
Then the conjugate direction     ofvu corresponds to the limit of the intersection of 
()
0
t
with
x
λ
SS 
as
 t tends to zero.  We leave the proof of this geometric interpretation for conjugate directions as 
an exercise. 
 
A direction represented by a self-conjugate vector 
v is called an asymptotic direction.  In 
this case 
v satisfies the equation 
 
 
()()
,0=⋅=Bvv    v  Bv                                                  (62.19)                                                  
 
Clearly, asymptotic directions exit at a point 
o
x if and only if 
o
x is hyperbolic or parabolic.  In 
the former case the asympototic directions are the same as those for the hyperbola given by 
(62.15), while in the latter case the asymptotic direction is unique and coincides with the 
direction of the parallel lines given by (62.15). 
 
If every point of 
S is hyperbolic, then the asymptotic lines form a coordinate net, and 
we can define an 
asymptotic coordinate system.  Relative to such a coordinate system the 
components 
b
ΓΔ
 satisfy the condition

A minimal surface which does not reduce to a plane is necessarily hyperbolic at every point,

From (62.12), 
S is parabolic at every point if and only if it is developable.  In this case 
the asymptotic lines are straight lines.  In fact, it can be shown that there are only three kinds of 
developable surfaces, namely cylinders, cones, and tangent developables.  Their asymptotic lines 
are simply their generators. Of course, these generators are also lines of curvature, since they are 
in the principal direction corresponding to the zero principal curvature.

ELEMENTS OF CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS GROUPS 
 
 
In this chapter we consider the structure of various classical continuous groups which are formed 
by linear transformations of an inner product space 
V.  Since the space of all linear transformation 
of Vis itself an inner product space, the structure of the continuous groups contained in it can be 
exploited by using ideas similar to those developed in the preceding chapter. In addition, the group 
structure also gives rise to a special parallelism on the groups. 
 
Section 63.  The General Linear Group and Its Subgroups 
 
 In section 17 we pointed out that the vector space 
()
;LV V
has the structure of an algebra, 
the product operation being the composition of linear transformations.  Since V is an inner product 
space, the transpose operation

is defined by (18.1); i.e.,  
 
                                                                          ,,

 From Theorem 22.2, a linear transformation 
()
;∈ALVV is an isomorphism of Vif and 
only if 
 
 
det0≠A                                                               (63.4)                                                               
 
Clearly, if A and B are isomorphisms, then AB and BA are also isomorphisms, and from Exercise 
22.1 we have

As a result, the set of all linear isomorphisms of 
Vforms a group 
()
GL    V
, called the general 
linear group 
of
V
.  This group was mentioned in Section 17.  We claim that 
()
GL    V is the disjoint 
union of two connected open sets in 
()
;LVV.  This fact is more of less obvious since 
()
GL    V is 
the reimage of the disjoint union 
()()
,00,−∞  ∪  ∞
 under the continuous map 
 
 
()
det :;→LVVR 
 
If we denote the primeages of 
()
,0−∞ and 
()
0,∞under the mapping det by 
()
−
GL    V and 
()
+
GL    V
, respectively, then they are disjoint connected open sets in
()
;LV V, and

Notice that from (63.5) 
()
+
GL    V is, but 
()
−
GL    V is not, closed with respect to the group 
operation.  So 
()
+
GL    V
is, but 
()
−
GL    V
is not, a subgroup of
()
GL    V.  We call the elements of 
()
+
GL    V and 
()
−
GL    V proper and improper transformations of
V
, respectively. They are 
separated by the hypersurface 
Sdefined by 
 
 
()
;anddet0∈⇔∈=AAASLVV 
 
Now since 
()
GL    V is an open set in 
()
;LVV, any coordinate system in 
()
;LVV 
corresponds to a coordinate system in 
()
GL    V
 when its coordinate neighborhood is restricted to a 
subset of
()
GL    V.  For example, if 
{}
i
eand 
{}
i
e are reciprocal bases forV, then 
{}
i
i
⊗eeis a basis 
for 
()
;LVV which gives rise to the Cartesian coordinate system
{}
j
i
X.  The restriction of 
{}
j
i
X 
to 
()
GL    V is then a coordinate system on
()
GL    V.  A Euclidean geometry can then be defined on 
()
GL    V
 as we have done in general on an arbitrary open set in a Euclidean space.  The Euclidean 
geometry on 
()
GL    V is not of much interest, however, since it is independent of the group 
structure on
()
GL    V. 
 
The group structure on 
()
GL    V
 is characterized by the following operations.

Clearly these operations are smooth mappings, so they give rise to various gradients which 
are fields of linear transformations of the underlying inner product space

the gradient of

where 
()
X
GL    V denotes the tangent space of 
()
GL    V at X, a notation consistent with that 
introduced in the preceding chapter.  Here, of course, 
()
X
GL    V coincides with 
()
;
X
LV V, which 
is a copy of 
()
;LVV
.  We inserted the argument X in 
()
∇
A
XL
 to emphasize the fact that 
()
∇
A
XL is a linear map from the tangent space of 
()
GL    V at X to the tangent space of 
()
GL    Vat 
the image point 
Y.  This mapping is given by (63.10) via the isomorphism of 
()
X
GL    V and 
()
Y
GL    V
 with 
()
;LVV
. 
 
 From (63.10) we see that the parallelism defined by (63.14) is not the same as the Euclidean 
parallelism.  Also, 
∇
A
L is not the same kind of parallelism as the Levi-Civita parallelism on a 
hypersurface because it is independent of any path joining 
X and Y.  In fact, if X and Y do not 
belong to the same connected set of 
()
GL    V, then there exists no smooth curve joining them at all, 
but the parallelism 
()
∇
A
XL is still defined.  We call the parallelism 
()
∇
A
XL with 
()
∈AGL    Vthe 
Cartan parallelism on 
()
GL    V
, and we shall study it in detail in the next section. 
 
 The choice of left multiplication rather than the right multiplication is merely a convention.

 Before closing the section, we mention here that besides the proper general linear group 
()
+
GL    V
, several other subgroups of 
()
GL    Vare important in the applications. First, the special 
linear group 
()
SL    V
is defined by the condition 
 
 
()
det1∈⇔=AASL    V                                                 (63.17)                                                 
 
Clearly 
()
SL    Vis a hypersurface of dimension 
2
1N− in the inner product space 
()
;LVV. 
Unlike  
()
GL    V
, 
()
SL    V
is a connected continuous group.  The unimodular group 
()
UM   V
is 
defined similiarly by 
 
 
()
det1∈⇔=AAUM   V                                                (63.18)                                                
 
Thus 
()
SL    V is the proper subgroup of 
()
UM   V, namely

            Next            the            orthogonal group

From (18.18) or (63.2) we see that 
Abelongs to 
()
OV if and only if it preserves the inner product 
of 
V, i.e., 
 
                                                                          ,,

Further, from (63.20) if 
()
,∈AOVthen det A has absolute value 1.  Consequently, 
()
OVis a 
subgroup of 
()
UM   V.  As usual, 
()
OVhas a proper component and an improper component, the 

468 Chap. 12 • CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS GROUP 
former being a subgroup of 
()
OV, denoted by 
()
SO   V, called the special orthogonal group or the 
rotational group of 
V.  As we shall see in Section 65, 
()
OV
is a hypersurface of dimension

As a result, 
()
OV is bounded in 
()
;LVV. 
 
            Since
()
UM   V, 
()
SL    V, 
()
OV, and 
()
SO   Vare subgroups of 
()
GL    V, the restrictions of 
the group operations of 
()
GL    V
can be identified as the group operations of the subgroups.  In 
particular, if 
()

Thus there exists a Cartan parallelism on the subgroups as well as on
()
GL    V.  The tangent spaces 
of the subgroups are subspaces of 
()
;LVV of course;  further , as explained in the preceding 
chapter, they vary from point to point.  We shall characterize the tangent spaces of

SL    V
and

SO   V at the identity element I in Section 66.  The tangent space at any other point can then be 
obtained by the Cartan parallelism, e.g.,

Section 64.  The Parallelism of Cartan 
 
 The concept of Cartan parallelism on 
()
GL    Vand on its various subgroups was introduced 
in the preceding section.  In this section, we develop the concept in more detail.  As explained 
before, the Cartan parallelism is path-independent.  To emphasize this fact, we now replace the

            Let            
V be a vector field on 
()
GL    V, that is  
 
 
()()
:;→VGL    VL    VV                                                  (64.5)                                                  
 
Then we say that 
V is a left-invarient field if its values are parallel vectors relative to the Cartan 
parallelism, i.e.,

470 Chap. 12 • CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS GROUP 
for any 
X, Y in 
()
GL    V.  Since the Cartan parallelism is not the same as the Euclidean parallelism 
induced by the inner product space
()
;LV V
, a left-invarient field is not a constant field.  From 
(64.2) we have the following representations for a left-invarient field.  
 
Theorem 64.1.  A vector field 
V
 is left-invariant if and only if it has the representation

for all 
()
∈XGL    V.  
 
 As a result, each tangent vector 
()
VI
 at the identity element I has a unique extension into 
a left-variant field.  Consequently, the set of all left-invariant fields, denoted by 
()
Vgl, is a copy 
of the tangent space 
()
I
GL    V which is canonically isomorphic to 
()
;LVV.  We call the 
restriction map

the standard representation of 
()
glV.  Since the elements of 
()
Vgl satisfy the representation 
(64.7), they characterize the Caratan parallelism completely by the condition (64.6) for 
all
()
∈VVgl.  In the next section we shall show that 
()
Vgl has the structure of a Lie algebra, 
so we call it the Lie Algebra of
()
GL    V. 
 
 Now using the Cartan parallelism 
()
,XYC
, we can define an opereation of covariant 
derivative by the limit of difference similar to (56.34), which defines the covariant derivative 
relative to the Levi-Civita parallelism.  Specifically, let 
()
tXbe a smooth curve in 
()
GL    V and let 
()
tUbe a vector field on 
()
tX.  Then we defince the covariant derivative of 
()

Since the Cartan parallelism is defined not just on 
()
GL    V
but also on the various continuous 
subgroups of 
()
GL    V, we may use the same formula (64.9) to define the covariant derivative of 
tangent vector fields along a smooth curve in the subgroups also.  For this reason we shall now 
derive a general representation for the covariant derivative relative to the Cartan parallelism 
without restricting the underlying continuous group to be the general linear group
()
GL    V.  Then 

Sec. 64            •            The Parallelism of Cartan 471 
we can apply the representation to vector fields on 
()
GL    V as well as to vector fields on the 
various continuous subgroups of
()
GL    V
, such as the special linear group
()
SL    V
. 
 
 The simplest way to represent the covariant derivative defined by (64.9) is to first express 
the vector field 
()
tU in component form relative to a basis of the Lie algebra of the underlying 
continuous group.  From (64.7) we know that the values 
()
{}
,1,...,M
Γ
Γ=EX of a left-invariant 
field of basis 
()
{}
,1,...,M
Γ
Γ=EX form a basis of the tangent space at Xfor all Xbelonging to 
the underlying group.  Here 
Mdenotes the dimension of the group; it is purposely left arbitrary so 
as to achieve generality in the representation.  Now since 
()
tU
is a tangent vector at
()
tX
, it can be 
represented as usual by the component form relative to the basis 
()

where Γis summed from 1 to 
M.  Substituting (64.10) into (64.9) and using the fact that the basis 
{}
Γ
Eis formed by parallel fields relative to the Cartan parallelism, we obtain directly

This formula is comparable to the representation of the covariant derivative relative to the 
Euclidean parallelism when the vector field is expressed in component form in the terms of a 
Cartesian basis. 
 
 As we shall see in the next section, the left-variant basis 
{}
Γ
E used in the representation 
(64.11) is not the natural basis of any coordinate system.  Indeed, this point is the major difference 
between the Cartan parallelism and the Euclidean parallelism, since relative to the latter a parallel 
basis is a constant basis which is the natural basis of a Cartesian coordinate system.  If we 
introduce a local coordinate system with natural basis

represent

T the torsion tensor of the Cartan 
parallelism.  To see the geometric meaning of this tensor, we substitute the formula (64.16) into 
(64.24) and rewrite the result in the following equivalent form:

Equation (64.27) is comparable to (49.21) and (55.31). 
 
 As we shall see in the next section, the Lie bracket of any pair of left-invariant fields is 
itself also a left-invariant field.  Indeed, this is the very reason that the set of all left-invariant fields 
is so endowed with the structure of a Lie algebra.  As a result, the components of ,

 Now the covariant derivative defined by (64.9) for vector fields can be generalized as in the

The formulas (64.30) and (64.32) represent the covariant derivative of a tangential tensor field 
A 
along a smooth curve 
()
tX
.  Now if A is a tangential tensor field defined on the continuous 
group, then we define the covariant derivative of 
A
 relative to the Cartan parallelism by a formula 
similar to (56.10) except that we replace the Christoffel symbols there by the Cartan symbols. 
 
 Naturally we say that a tensor field 
A is left-invariant if 
∇A
vanishes. The torsion tensor 
field 
T given by (64.29) is an example of a left-invariant third-order tensor field.  Since a tensor 
field is left invariant if and only if its components relative to the product basis of a left-invariant 
basis are constants, a representation formally generalizing (64.7) can be stated for left-invariant 
tensor fields in general. In particular, if

476 Chap. 12 • CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS GROUP 
 
Section 65.  One-Parameter Groups and the Exponential Map 
 
 In section 57 of the preceding chapter we have introduced the concepts of geodesics and 
exponential map relative to the Levi-Civita parallelism on a hypersurface.  In this section we 
consider similar concepts relative to the Cartan parallelism.  As before, we define a 
geodesic to be a 
smooth curve 
()
tX such that


                                                                (65.1)                                                                
 
where X

denotes the tangent vector X and where the covariant derivative is taken relative to the 
Cartan parallelism. 
 
 Since (65.1) is formally the same as (57.1), relative to a coordinate system 
()
X
Γ
we have 
the following 
equations of geodesics

which are comparable to (57.2).  However, the equations of geodesics here are no longer the Euler-
Lagrange equations of the arc length integral, since the Cartan parallelism is not induced by a 
metric and the arc length integral is not defined.  To interpret the geometric meaning of a geodesic 
relative to the Cartan parallelism, we must refer to the definition (64.9) of the covariant derivative. 
 
 We notice first that if we express the tangent vector

then from (64.11) a necessary and sufficient condition for 
()
tX to be a geodesic is that the 
components

be constant independent of t.  Equivalently, this condition means that

where G is a left-invariant field having the component form

Sec. 65            •            One-Parameter Groups, Exponential Map 477 
where 
G
Γ
are constant.  In other words, a curve 
()
tX is a geodesic relative to the Cartan 
parallelism if and only if it is an integral curve of a left-invariant vector field. 
 
 This characteristic property of a geodesic implies immediately the following result. 
 
Theorem 65.1.  If 
()
tXis a geodesic tangent to the left-invariant field G, then 
()
()
t
A
XL is also a 
geodesic tangent to the same left-invariant field G for all Ain the underlying continuous group. 
 
 A corollary of this theorem is that every geodesic can be extended indefinitely from 
t=−∞ 
to 
t=+∞.  Indeed, if 
()
tXis a geodesic defined for an interval, say 
[]
0,1t∈, then we can extend 
()

and so forth.  An important consequence of this extension is the following result.  
 
Theorem 65.2.  A smooth curve

if and only if it forms a one-parameter group, i.e.,

which shows that

478 Chap. 12 • CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS GROUP 
 Now combining the preceding propositions, we see that the class of all geodesics can be 
characterized in the following way.  First, for each left-invariant field 
G there exists a unique one-
parameter group 
()
tX such that

0=XGI

                                                          (65.11)                                                          
 
where 
()
GI
is the standard representation of G.  Next, the set of all geodesics tangent to G can be 
represented by 
()
()
t
A
XL for all Abelonging to the underlying group. 
 
 As in Section 57, the one-to-one correspondence between 
()
GI
and 
()
tX
gives rise to the 
notion of the exponential map at the indentity elementI.  For brevity, let 
A
be the standard 
representation of 
G, i.e.,

                                                            (65.12)                                                            
 
Then we define

which is comparable to (57.19).  As explained in Section 57,  (65.13) implies that

for all 
t∈R.  Here we have used the extension property of the geodesic.  Equation (65.14) formally 
represents the one-parameter group whose initial tangent vector at the identity element I is A. 
 
 We claim that the exponential map defined by (65.13) can be represented explicitly by the 
exponential series

for all positive integers

This completes the proof of the representation (65.18). 
 
 We summarize our results as follows.

where the initial point

This formula implies immediately that

Substituting (65.24) and (65.25) into (65.23) and using the power series representation (65.18), we 
obtain

which shows that

,GK is left-invariant with the standard representation −AB   BA.  Hence in 
terms of the standard representation the Lie bracket on the Lie algebra is given by

is called a Lie Algebra.  From (65.27) the Lie bracket of left-invariant fields clearly satisfies the 
identities (65.28) and (65.29).  As a result, the set of all left-invariant fields has the structure of a 
Lie algebra with respect to the Lie bracket.  This is why that set is called the Lie algebra of the 
underlying group, as we have remarked in the preceding section.

 Before closing the section, we remark that the Lie algebra of a continuous group depends 
only on the identity component of the group.  If two groups share the same identity component, 
then their Lie algebras are essentially the same.  For example, the Lie algebra of

GL    Vare both representable by

component of the underlying group in more detail in the next section.

Section 66.  Subgroups and Subalgebras 
 
 In the preceding section we have shown that the set of left invariant fields is closed with 
respect to the Lie bracket.  This is an important property of a continuous group.  In this section we 
shall elaborate further on this property by proving that there exists a one-to-one correspondence 
between a connected continuous subgroup of 
()
GL    V and a subalgebra of 
()
Vgl.  Naturally we 
call a subspace 
h of 
()
Vgl  a subalgebra if h is closed with respect to the Lie bracket, i.e., 
[]
∈G, Hh
 whenever both andGH belong to 
h
.  We claim that for each subalgebra 
h
 of 
()
Vgl there corresponds uniquely a connected continuous subgroup Hof 
()
GL    V
 whose Lie 
algebra coincides with the restriction of 
h onH. 
 
 First, suppose that 
H is a continuous subgroup of
()
GL    V, i.e., H is algebraically a 
subgroup of 
()
GL    V and geometrically a smooth hyper surface in
()
GL    V.  For example, Hmay 
be the orthogonal group or the special linear group.  Then the set of all left-invariant tangent vector 
fields on 
Hforms a Lie algebra h.  We claim that every element Vin h can be extended uniquely 
into a left-invariant vector field 
V
on
()
GL    V.  Indeed, this extension is provided by the 
representation (64.7).  That is, we simply define

for all 
()
∈XGL    V.  Here we have used the fact that the Cartan parallelism on H is the restriction 
of that on

GL    V toH.  Therefore, when∈XH, the representation (66.1) reduces to

            From            (66.1),

for all

V
in h.  This condition shows that the extension hof h consisting of all left-
invariant fields 
Vwith Vin h is a Lie subalgebra of
()
Vgl.  In view of (66.1) and (66.2), we 
simplify the notation by suppressing the overbar.  If this convention is adopted, then 
h becomes a 
Lie subalgebra of
()
Vgl. 
 
            Since            the            inclusion            
()
⊂Vhglis based on the extension (66.1), if 
1

2
H are 
continuous subgroups of 
()
GL    V having the same identity components, then their Lie algebras 
1
hand 
2
hcoincide as Lie subalgebras of
()
Vgl.  In this sense we say that the Lie algebra 
characterizes only the identity component of the underlying group, as we have remarked at the end 
of the preceding section. In particular, the Lie algebra of 
()
UM   Vcoincides with that of
()
SL    V. 
 
 It turns out that every Lie subalgebra of 
()
Vgl can be identified as the Lie algebra of a 
unique connected continuous subgroup of
()
Vgl.  To prove this, let 
h
 be an arbitrary Lie 
subalgebra of
()
Vgl.  Then the values of the left-invariant field belonging to 
h
 form a linear 
subspace of 
()
;LV V at each point of 
()
GL    V.  This field of subspaces is a distribution on 
()
GL    V as defined in Section 50.  According to the Frobenius theorem, the distribution is 
integrable if and only if it is closed with respect to the Lie bracket.  This condition is clearly 
satisfied since 
h is a Lie subalgebra.  As a result, there exists an integral hypersurface of the 
distribution at each point in
()
GL    V. 
 
 We denote the maximal connected integral hypersurface of the distribution at the identity 
by 
H.  Here maximality means that H is not a proper subset of any other connected integral 
hypersurface of the distribution.  This condition implies immediately that 
His also the maximal 
connected integral hypersurface at any point X which belongs to
H.  By virtue of this fact we 
claim that  
 
 
()
=
X
HHL                                                            (66.3)                                                            
 
for all ∈X
H.  Indeed, since the distribution is generated by left-invariant fields, its collection of 
maximal connected integral hypersurfaces is invariant under any left multiplication.  In particular, 
()
X
HL
 is the maximal connected integral hypersurface at the point X, since Hcontains the 
identityI.  As a result, (66.3) holds.  
 
 Now from (66.3) we see that 
∈XH implies 
1−
∈XH since 
1−
Xis the only possible element 
such that
()
1−
=
X
XIL.  Similiarly, if X and Y are contained inH, then XY must also be contained 
in 
H since XY is the only possible element such that
()
1−−

1
YX
XYILL
. For the last condition we 
have used the fact that

which follows from (66.3) and the fact that 
1−
Xand 
−1
Y are both in H.  Thus we have shown that 
His a connected continuous subgroup of 
()
GL    Vhaving h as its Lie algebra. 
 
 Summarizing the results obtained so far, we can state the following theorem. 
 
Theorem 66.1.  There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of Lie subalgebras of 
()
Vgland the set of connected continuous subgroups of 
()
GL    V in such a way that each Lie 
subalgebra 
h of 
()
Vgl is the Lie algebra of a unique connected continuous subgroup Hof 
()
GL    V
. 
 
 To illustrate this theorem, we now determine explicitly the Lie algebras

where trAdenotes the trace of A.  To prove this, we consider the one-parameter group 
()

for any

 From the representation (65.27) the reader will verify easily that the subspace of

which can be verified directly from (65.15).  The condition (66.7) clearly follows from the 
condition (66.8).  From (65.27) the reader also will verify the fact that the subpace of 
()
;LV Vcharacterized by the right-hand side is a Lie subalgebra.  
 
 The conditions (66.4) and (66.7) characterize completely the tangent spaces of

486 Chap. 12 • CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS GROUP 
 
 
Section 67.  Maximal Abelian Subgroups and Subalgebras 
 
 
In this section we consider the problem of determining the Abelian subgroups of
()
GL    V.  
Since we shall use the Lie algebras to characterize the subgroups, our results are necessarily 
restricted to connected continuous Abelian subgroups only.  We define first the tentative notion of 
a maximal Abelian subset Hof 
()
GL    V.  The subset His required to satisfy the following two 
conditions: 
 
(i)
 Any pair of elements X and Y belonging to Hcommute. 
(ii)
 His not a proper subset of any subset of 
()
GL    V satisfying condition (i). 
 
Theorem 67.1. A maximal Abelian subset is necessarily a subgroup. 
 
 The proof is more or less obvious.  Clearly, the identity element I is a member of every 
maximal Abelian subset.  Next, if X belongs to a certain maximal Abelian subset
H, then 
1−
Xalso 
belongs to H.  Indeed, ∈XH means that 
 
 ,
=∈XY   YXYH                                                     (67.1)                                                     
 
Multiplying this equation on the left and on the right by 
1−
X, we get 
 
 
11

−−
=∈YXX   YYH                                                    (67.2)                                                    
 
As a result, 
1−
∈XH since His maximal.  By the same argument we can prove also that 
∈XYHwhenever ∈XHand∈YH.  Thus, His a subgroup of
()
GL    V. 
 
 In view of this theorem and the opening remarks we shall now consider the maximal, 
connected, continuous, Abelian subgroups of
()
GL    V
.  Our first result is the following. 
 
Theorem 67.2.  The one-parameter groups 
()
exptAand 
()
exptBcommute if and only if their 
initial tangents Aand Bcommute.  
 
 Sufficiency is obvious, since when 
=AB   BA
 the series representations for 
()
exptAand 
()
exptB
imply directly that
()
exptA
()
exptB
()()
expexptt=BA
.  In fact, we have

expexpexpexpexpttt   tt=+=ABABBA 
 

Sec. 66            •            Maximal Abelian Subgroups, Subalgebras 487 
in this case.  Conversely, if 
()
exptAand 
()
exptBcommute, then their initial tangents 
A
 and B 
must also commute, since we can compare the power series expansions for 
() ()
expexpttAB
and 
() ()
expexpttBA for sufficiently small t.  Thus the proposition is proved. 
 
 We note here a word of caution: While the assertion  
 
 
()()()()
expexpexpexp=⇒=AB   BAABBA                                 (67.3)                                 
 
is true, its converse is not true in general.  This is due to the fact that the exponential map is local 
diffeomorphism, but globally it may or may not be one-to-one.  Thus there exists a nonzero 
solution A for the equation 
 
 
()
exp=AI
                                                             (67.4)

(ii)

488 Chap. 12 • CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS GROUP 
 
To prove the preceding theorem, we need the following lemma. 
 
Lemma.  Let H be an arbitrary connected continuous subgroup of 
()
GL    V and let Nbe a 
neighborhood of Iin
H.  Then His generated byN, i.e., every element X of Hcan be expressed 
as a product (not unique) 
 
 
12k
=⋅⋅⋅XYY  Y                                                           (67.7)                                                           
 
where 
i
Yor 
1
i
−
Ybelongs toN.  [The number of factors k in the representation (67.7) is arbitrary.] 
 
 Note. Since 
H
is a hypersurface in the inner product space
()
;LV V, we can define a 
neighborhood system on Hsimply by the intersection of the Euclidean neighborhood system on 
()
;LV Vwith
H
.  The topology defined in this way on 
H
is called the induced topology. 
 
 To prove the lemma, let 
0
H be the subgroup generated by N.  Then 
0
His an open set in 
Hsince from (67.7) every point 
0
∈XH has a neighborhood 
()
X
NLinH. On the other hand, 
0
His also a closed set in H because the complement of 
0
Hin H is the union of 
()
0Y
HL
, 
0
∈Y
H
H
 which are all open sets inH.  As a result 
0
Hmust coincide with Hsince by hypothesis 
H
has only one component. 
 
 By virtue of the lemma 
H is Abelian if and only if Nis an Abelian set.  Combining this 
remark with Theorem 67.2, and using the fact that the exponential map is a local diffeomorphism at 
the identity element, we can conclude immediately that His a maximal connected continuous 
Abelian subgroup of 
()
GL    V
 if and only if 
h
is a maximal Abelian Lie subalgebra of 
()
Vgl. 
This completes the proof. 
 
 It should be noticed that on a connected Abelian continuous subgroup of 
()
GL    V the 
Cartan parallelism reduced to a Euclidean parallelism.  Indeed, since the Lie bracket vanishes 
identically on
h, any invariant basis

is a homomorphism of the additive group 
M
R
with the Abelian group
H
.  This coordinate system 
plays the role of a local Cartesian coordinate system on a neighborhood of the identity element 
of
H. The mapping defined by (67.8) may or may not be one-to-one.  In the former case His 
isomorphic to 
M
R, in the latter case His isomorphic to a cylinder or a torus of dimension M.  

Sec. 66            •            Maximal Abelian Subgroups, Subalgebras 489 
 
 We say that the Cartan parallelism on the Abelian group His a Euclidean parallelism 
because there exists a local Cartesian coordinate system relative to which the Cartan symbols 
vanish identically.  This Euclidean parallelsin on 
H
 should not be confused with the Eucliedean 
parallelism on the underlying inner product space 
()
;LV V
 in which His a hypersurface.  In 
genereal, even if 
H
is Abelian, the tangent spaces at different points of 
H
 are still different 
subspaces of 
()
;LV V
.  Thus the Euclidean parallelism on His not the restriction of the 
Euclidean parallelism of 
()
;LV Vto
H
.

INTEGRATION OF FIELDS ON EUCLIDEAN MANIFORDS, 
HYPERSURFACES, AND CONTINUOUS GROUPS 
 
 
In  this  chapter  we  consider  the  theory  of  integration  of  vector  and  tensor  fields  defined  on  
various  geometric  entities  introduced  in  the  preceding  chapters.    We  assume  that  the  reader  is  
familiar  with  the  basic  notion  of  the  Riemann  integral  for  functions  of  several  real  variables.    
Since we shall restrict our attention to the integration of continuous fields only, we do not need 
the more general notion of the Lebesgue integral.

We claim that the arc length possesses the following properties which justify the definition 
(68.3). 
 
(i) The arc length depends only on the path of λ joining

()

independent of the choice of parameterization on the path.

which proves property (i). 
 
 
(ii)  When the path joining

given by

 This property can be verified by using the parameterization

(iii)
 The arc length integral is additive, i.e., the sum of the arc lengths from 
()   ()
toabλλand from 
()  ()
tobcλλis equal to the arc length from

 Now using property (i), we can parameterize the path of 
λby the arc length relative to a 
certain reference point on the path.  As usual, we assume that the path is oriented.  Then we 
assign a positive parameter 
s to a point on the positive side and a negative parameter s to a 
point on the negative side of the reference point, the absolute value 
s being the arc length 

Sec. 68            •            Arc Length, Surface Area, Volume 493 
between the point and the reference point.  Hence when the parameter t is positively oriented, 
the arc length parameter 
s is related to t by

where

0λ is chosen as the reference point. From (68.11) we get

                                                        (68.12)                                                        
 
Substituting this formula into the general transformation rule (68.6), we see that the tangent 
vector relative to 
s is a unit vector pointing in the positive direction of the path, as it should be. 
 
 Having defined the concept of arc length, we consider next the concept of surface area.  
For simplicity we begin with the area of a two-dimensional smooth surface 
S in E.  As usual, 
we can characterize 
S in terms of a pair of parameters 
()

Γ
Γ= which form a local 
coordinate system on 
S

where 
ȗ is a smooth mapping.  We denote the tangent vector of the coordinate curves by 
 
 
/,1,2u

Γ
≡∂ ∂Γ=hȗ                                                (68.14)                                                
 
Then 
{}
Γ
his a basis of the tangent plane 
x
S of 
S
 at any x given by (68.13).  We assume that 
S is oriented and that 
()
u
Γ
 is a positive coordinate system.  Thus 
{}
Γ
h
is also positive for 
x
S. 
 
            Now            let            
U
 be a domain in 
S
 with piecewise smooth boundary.  We consider first the 
simple case when

by virtue of (68.17).  From (68.26) the coordinate system 
()
u
Γ
and 
()
u
Γ
are of the same 
orientation.  Hence if 
()
u
Γ
 is positively oriented, then 
()
u
Γ
 is a positive isochoric coordinate 
system on 
S. 
 
 An isochoric coordinate system 
()
u
Γ
=xȗin corresponds to an isochoric mapping ȗ 
from a domain in 
2
R
 onto the coordinate neighborhood of ȗ in 
S
.  In general, ȗ is not 
isometric, so that the surface metric a
ΓΔ
 relative to 
()
u

 need not be a Euclidean metric.  In fact, 
the surface metric is Euclidean if and only if 
S is developable.  Hence an isometric coordinate 

496 Chap. 13 • INTEGRATION OF FIELDS 
system (i.e., a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system) generally does not exist on an arbitrary 
surface 
S.  But the preceding proof shows that isochoric coordinate systems exist on all S. 
 
 So far, we have defined the surface area for any domain 
U
 which can be covered by a 
single surface coordinate system.  Now suppose that 
U is not homeomorphic to a domain in 
2
R.  
Then we decompose 
U into a collection of subdomains, say

whee the interiors of 
1

UU... are mutually disjoint.  We assume that each 
a
U can be covered by 
a surface coordinate system so that the surface area 
()
a
σUis defined.  Then we define

σU 
naturally by

While the decomposition (68.28) is not unique, of course, by the additive property (vi) of the 
integral we can verify easily that 
()
σU
 is independent of the decomposition.  Thus the surface 
area is well defined. 
 
 Having considered the concepts of arc length and surface area in detail, we can now 
extend theidea to hypersurfaces in general.  Specifically, let 
S
 be a hupersurface of dimension 
M.  Then locally 
S can be represented by

where 
ȗ is a smooth mapping.  We define

Then the

Section 69.  Integration of Vector Fields and Tensor Fields 
 
 In the preceding section we have defined the concept of surface area for an arbitrary M-
dimensional hyper surface imbedded in an N-dimensional Euclidean manifold 
.E  When 1M=, 
the surface reduces to a path and the surface area becomes the arc length, while in the case M=N  
the surface corresponds to a domain in 
,Eand the surface area becomes the volume.  In this 
section we shall define the integrals of various fields relative to the surface area of an arbitrary 
hyper surface 
S.  We begin with the integral of a continuous function f defined on S. 
 
 As before, we assume that 
S is oriented and U is a domain in S with piecewise 
smoothboundary.  We consider first the simple case when 
U can be covered by a single surface 
coordinate system

 The integrals defined by (69.10) and (69.12) possess the same tensorial order as the 
integrand.  The fact that a Cartesian coordinate system is used in (69.10) and (69.12) reflects 
clearly the crucial dependence of the integral on the Euclidean parallelism of 
.E
  Without the 
Euclidean parallelism it is generally impossible to add vectors or tensors at different points of the 
domain.  Then an integral is also meaningless.  For example, if we suppress the Euclidean 
parallelism on the underlying Euclidean manifold 
,E
 then the tangential vectors or tensors at 
different points of a hyper surface 
S
 generally do not belong to the same tangent space or tensor 
space.  As a result, it is generally impossible to “sum” the values of a tangential field to obtain an 
integral without the use of some kind of path-independent parallelism.  The Euclidean 
parallelism is just one example of such parallelisms.  Another example is the Cartan parallelism 
on a continuous group defined in the preceding chapter.  We shall consider integrals relative to 
the Cartan parallelism in Section 72. 
 
 In view of (69.10) and (69.12) we see that the integral of a vector field or a tensor field 
possesses the following properties.

Section 70.  Integration of Differential Forms 
 
 Integration with respect to the surface area density of a hyper surface is a special case of 
a more general integration of differential forms.  As remarked in Section 68, the transformation 
rule (68.17) of the surface area density is the basic condition which implies the important 
property that the surface area integral is independent of the choice of the surface coordinate 
system.  Since the transformation rule (68.17) is essentially the same as that of the strict 
components of certain differential forms, we can extend the operation of integration to those 
forms also.  This extension is the main result of this section. 
 
 We begin with the simple notion of a differential 
N-form Z on E.   By definition, Z is a 
completely skew-symmetric covariant tensor field of order 
N.  Thus relative to any coordinate 
system

This formula is comparable to (68.17).  In fact if we require that

uand 
()

u both be positively 
oriented, then (70.2) can be regarded as a special case of (68.17) with .

504 Chap. 13 • INTEGRATION OF FIELDS 
Here we have assumed that the coordinate system is positively oriented; otherwise, a negative 
sign should be inserted on the right hand side since the volume density 
e as defined by (68.16) is 
always positive.  Hence, unlike the volume integral, the integral of a differential N-form 
Z
 is 
defined only if the underlying space 
E
 is oriented.  Other than this aspect, the integral of Z and 
the volume integral have essentially the same properties since they both are defined by an 
invariant N-tuple integral over the coordinates. 
 
Now more generally let 
S be an oriented hypersurface in E of dimension M, and 
suppose 
Z is a tangential differential M-form on S.  As before, we choose a positive surface 
coordinate system

Γ
 on S and represent Z by

and the integral is independentof the choice of the positive surface coordinate system 
()
.u
Γ
  By 
the same remark as before, we can regard (70.7) as a generalization of (68.33). 
 
 The definition (70.7) is valid for any tangential M-form 
Z on S.  In this definition the 
surface metric and thesurface area density are not used.  The fact that 
Z is a tangential field on 
S is not essential in the definition.  Indeed, if Z is an arbitrary skew-symmetric spatial 
covariant tensorof order M on 
S, then we define the density of Z on S relative to 
()
u
Γ
 simply 
by

Using this density, we define the integral of 
Z again by (70.7).  Of course, the formula (70.8) is 
valid for a tangential M-form 
Z also, since it merely represents the strict component of the 
tangential projection of 
Z. 
 
 This remark can be further generalized in the following situation:  Suppose that 
S is a 
hyper surface contained in another hypersurface 
0
S in E, and let Z be a tangential M-form on 

Sec. 70            •            Integration of Differential Forms 505 
0
S.  Then Z gives rise to a density on S by the same formula (70.8), and the integral of Z over 
any domain 
U in S is defined by (70.7).  Algebraically, this remark is a consequence of the 
simple fact that a skew-symmetric tensor over the tangent space of 
0
S gives rise to a unique 
skew-symmetric tensor over the tangent space of 
S
, since the latter tangent space is a subspace 
of the former one. 
 
 It should be noted, however, that the integral of 
Z is defined over S only if the order of 
Z
 coincides with the dimension of S.  Further, the value of theintegral is always a scalar, not a 
vector or a tensor as in the preceding section.  We can regard the intetgral of a vector field or a 
tensor field as a special case of the integral of a differential form only when the fields are 
represented interms of their Cartesian components as shown in (69.9) and (69.11). 
 
 An important special case of the integral of a differential form is the line integral in 
classical vector analysis.  In this case 
S
 reduces to an oriented path λ, and Z is a 1-form .w  
When the Euclidean metric on 
E is used, wcorresponds simply to a (spatial or tangential) vector 
field on

 Since the multipleof an 
M-form Zby a scalar field f remains an M-form, we can define 
the integral of 
f with respect to Z simply as the integral of fZ.  Using a Cartesian coordinate 
representation, we can extend this operation to integrals of a vector field or a tensor field relative 
to a differential form.  The integrals defined in the preceding section are special cases of this 
general operation when the differential forms are the Euclidean surface area densities induced 
bythe Euclidean metric on the underlying space 
.E

 In Section 51 we have defined the operation of exterior derivative on differential forms 
on

parallelism, it can be defined also for tangential differential forms on a hyper surface, as we have 
remarked in Section 55.  Specifically, if

Generalized Stokes’ Theorem.  Let S and 
0
S be hypersurfaces as defined in the preceding 
lemma and suppose that 
Uis an oriented domain in S with piecewise smooth boundary .∂U  
(We orient the boundary 
∂U as usual by requiring the outward normal of ∂Ube the positive 
normal.)  Then for any tangential 
()
1M−-form Z on 
0
S we have

 Before proving this theorem, we remark first that other than the condition 
 
 
0
⊂SS                                                              (71.11)                                                              
 
The hypersurface 
0
S is entirely arbitrary.  In application we often take 
0
=SE but this choice is 
not necessary.  Second, by virtue of the preceding lemma it suffices to prove (71.10) for 
tangential 
()
1M−−forms 
Z
 on S only.  In other words, we can choose 
0
S to be the same as 
S without loss of generality.  Indeed, as explained in the preceding section, the integrals in 
(71.10) are equal to those of tangential projection of the forms 
Z
 and dZ on S.  Then by virtue 
of the lemma the formula (71.10) amounts to nothing but a formula for tangential forms on 
S
. 
 
 Before proving the formula (71.10) in general, we consider first the simplest special case 
when 
Z is a 1-form and S is a two-dimensional surface.  This case corresponds to the Stokes 
formula in classical vector analysis.  As usual, we denote a 1-form by 
wsince it is merely a 
covariant vector field on 
S.  Let the component form of w in 
()
u
Γ
 be 
 
 
w

=wh                                                            (71.12)                                                            
 
where Γ is summed from 1 to 2.  From (71.2) the exterior derivative of 
w is a 2-form

cube with an appropriate orientation on each face.  Thus (71.10) is proved when (71.22) holds. 
 
 In general, if 
U
cannot be represented by (71.22), then we decompose

Sec. 72            •            Invariant Integrals on Continuous Groups 515 
 
Section 72. Invariant Integrals on Continuous Groups 
 
 In the preceding chapter we have considered various groups which are also hypersurfaces 
contained in the Euclidean space
()
;LVV
.  Since the integrations defined so far in this chapter 
can be applied to any hypersurface in a Euclidean manifold, in particular they can be applied to 
the continuous groups.  However, these integrations are generally unrelated to the group 
structure and thus their applications are limited. This situation is similar to that about parallelism. 
While the induced metric and its Levi-Civita parallelism certainly exist on the underlying 
hypersurface of the group, they are not significant mathematically because they do not reflect the 
group structure. This remark has led us to consider the Cartan parallelism which is defined by the 
left-invariant fields on the group.  
 Now as far as integrationis concerned, the natural choice for a continuous group is the 
integration based on a left-invarianct volume density.  Specifically, if 
{}
Γ
eis a basis for the Lie 
algebra of the group, then a volume tensor field 
Zis a left-invariant if and only if it can be 
represented by  
 
 
1M
c=∧⋅⋅⋅∧eeZ                                                         (72.1)

for all elements 
Xbelonging to the group. 
 
 A left-invariant volume tensor field 
Zis also right-invariant if and only if it is invariant 
under the inversion operation 
Jwhen the dimension Mof the group is even or it is mapped into 
−Zby JJwhen Mis odd.  This fact is more or less obvious since in general Jmaps any left-
invariant field into a right-invariant field.  Also, the gradient of 
Jat the identity element 
coincides with the negation operation.  Consequently, when 
Mis even, 
()
IZ is invaritant 
under
J, while if Mis odd, 
()
IZ
is mapped into 
()
−IZ
 byJ.  Naturally we call Zan invariant 
volume tensor field if it is both left-invariant and right-invariant.  Relative to an invariant 
Zthe 
integral obeys the condition (72.2) as well as the conditions

Here we have used the fact that 
Jpreserves the orientatin of the group when Mis even, while 
J reverses the orientation of the group when Mis odd. 

516 Chap. 13 • INTEGRATION OF FIELDS 
 By virtue of the representation (72.1) all left-invariant volume tensor fields differ from 
one another by a constant multiple only and thus they are either all right-invariant or all not 
right-invariant.  As we shall see, the left-invariant volume tensor fields on 
()
GLV, 
()
SLV, 
()
OV
, and all continuous subgroups of 
()
OV
are right-invariant.  Hence invariant integrals 
exist on these groups.  We consider first the general linear group 
()
GLV. 
 
 To prove that the left-invariant volume tensor fields on the 
()
GLV are also right-
invariant, we recall first from exterior algebra the transformation rule for a volume tensor under a 
linear map of the underlying vector space.  Let 
Wbe an arbitrary vector space of dimension M, 
and suppose that 
A
is a linear transformation of W 
 
 :
→AWW                                                            (72.4)                                                            
 
Then 
Amaps any volume tensor E on

Then by virtue of (72.5) a left-invariant field volume tensor field is also right-invariant if and

To prove (72.10), we have to show that the

Thus invariant integrals exist on 
()
GLV
. 
 
 The situation with the subgroup 
()
SLVor 
()
UMVis somewhat more complicated, 
however, because the tangent planes at distinct points of the underlying group generally are not 
the same subspace of 
()
;LVV.  We recall first that the tangent plane of 
()
SLVat the 
identity
Iis the hyperplane consisting of all tensors

such that 
 
 
()
0tr=K                                                            (72.14)                                                            
 
This result means that the orthogonal complement of 
()
I
SLV relative to the inner product on

;LVV
is the one-dimensional subspace

Now from (72.8) and (72.9) the linear maps 
R∇

coincide on l, namely

518 Chap. 13 • INTEGRATION OF FIELDS 
 
By virtue of (72.16) and (72.10) we see that the restrictions of 
R∇
X
and L∇
X
on 
()
I
SLV give 
rise to the same volume tensor at 
Xfrom any volume tensor at I.  As a result every left-
invariant volume tensor field on

SLV
or 
()
UMV
is also a right-invariant, and thus invariant 
integrals exist on 
()
SLVand
()
UMV.  
 
 Finally, we show that invariant integrals exists on

 preserve the inner product
