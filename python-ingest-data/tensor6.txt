This booklet contains an explanation about tensor calculusfor students of physics
and engineering with a basic knowledge of linear algebra. The focus lies mainly on
acquiring an understanding of the principles and ideas underlying the concept of
‘tensor’. We have not pursued mathematical strictness and pureness, but instead
emphasise practical use (for a more mathematically pure resum ́e, please see the bib-
liography). Although tensors are applied in a very broad range of physics and math-
ematics, this booklet focuses on the application in specialand general relativity.
We are indebted to all people who read earlier versions of this manuscript and gave
useful comments, in particular G. B ̈auerle (University of Amsterdam) and C. Dulle-
mond Sr. (University of Nijmegen).
The original version of this booklet, in Dutch, appeared on October 28th, 1991. A
major update followed on September 26th, 1995. This versionis a re-typeset English
translation made in 2008/2010.

The index notation
Before we start with the main topic of this booklet, tensors,we will first introduce a
new notation for vectors and matrices, and their algebraic manipulations: the index
notation. It will prove to be much more powerful than the standard vector nota-
tion. To clarify this we will translate all well-know vectorand matrix manipulations
(addition, multiplication and so on) to index notation.
Let us take a manifold (=space) with dimensionn. We will denote the compo-
nents of a vector~vwith the numbersv
1
, . . . ,v
n
. If one modifies the vector basis, in
which the componentsv
1
, . . . ,v
n
of vector~vare expressed, then these components
will change, too. Such a transformation can be written usinga matrixA, of which
the columns can be regarded as the old basis vectors~e

expressed in the new
basis~e

the next chapter we will say more about the transformation ofvectors.

From the exercises it should have become clear that the summation symbols
∑
can always be put at the start of the formula and that their order is irrelevant. We can
therefore in principle omit these summation symbols, if we make clear in advance
over which indices we perform a summation, for instance by putting them after the
formula,

From the exercises one can already suspect that
•almost never is a summation performed over an index if that index only ap-
pears once in a product,
•almost always a summation is performed over an index that appears twice in
a product,
•an index appears almost never more than twice in a product.

CHAPTER 1. THE INDEX NOTATION
When one uses index notation in every day routine, then it will soon become
irritating to denote explicitly over which indices the summation is performed. From
experience (see above three points) oneknowsover which indices the summations
are performed, so one will soon have the idea to introduce theconvention that,
unless explicitly stated otherwise:
•a summation is assumed over all indices that appear twice in aproduct, and
•nosummation is assumed over indices that appear only once.
From now on we will write all our formulae in index notation with this particular
convention, which is called theEinstein summation convection. For a more detailed
look at index notation with the summation convention we refer to [
4]. We will thus
from now on rewrite

Bases, co- and contravariant vectors
In this chapter we introduce a new kind of vector (‘covector’), one that will be es-
sential for the rest of this booklet. To get used to this new concept we will first show
in an intuitive way how one can imagine this new kind of vector. After that we will
follow a more mathematical approach.
2.1. Intuitive approach
We can map the space around us using a coordinate system. Let us assume that
we use a linear coordinate system, so that we can use linear algebra to describe
it. Physical objects (represented, for example, with an arrow-vector) can then be
described in terms of the basis-vectors belonging to the coordinate system (there
are some hidden difficulties here, but we will ignore these for the moment).  In
this section we will see what happens when we choose another set of basis vectors,
i.e. what happens upon a basis transformation.
In a description with coordinates we must be fully aware thatthe coordinates
(i.e. the numbers) themselves have no meaning. Only with thecorresponding basis
vectors (which span up the coordinate system) do these numbers acquire meaning.
It is important to realize that the object one describes is independent of the coordi-
nate system (i.e. set of basis vectors) one chooses. Or in other words: an arrow does
not change meaning when described an another coordinate system.
Let us write down such a basis transformation,
~e

′
=a
11
~e

~e

,
~e
2
′
=a

~e

+a
22
~e
2
.
(2.1)
This could be regarded as a kind of multiplication of a ‘vector’ with a matrix, as long
as we take for the components of this ‘vector’ the basis vectors. If we describe the
matrix elements with words, one would get something like:


Note that the basis vector-colums

arenotvectors, but just a very useful way to
write things down.
We can also look at what happens with the components of avectorif we use a
different set of basis vectors. From linear algebra we know that the transformation

It is clear that the matrices of Eq. (
2.2) and Eq. (2.3) arenotthe same.
We now want to compare the basis-transformation matrix of Eq. (2.2) with the
coordinate-transformation matrix of Eq. (
2.3). To do this we replace all the primed
elements in the matrix of Eq. (
2.3) by non-primed elements and vice-versa. Compar-
ison with the matrix in Eq. (2.2) shows that we also have to transpose the matrix. So
if we call the matrix of Eq. (
2.2)Λ, then Eq. (2.3) is equivalent to:
~v
′
= (Λ
−1
)
T
~v.(2.4)
The normal vectors are called ‘contravariant vectors’, because they transform con-
trary to the basis vector columns. That there must be a different behavior is also
intuitively clear: if we described an ‘arrow’ by coordinates, and we then modify the
basis vectors, then the coordinates must clearly change in the opposite way to make
sure that the coordinates times the basis vectors produce the same physical ‘arrow’
(see Fig.
??).
In view of these two opposite transformation properties, wecould now attempt
to construct objects that, contrary to normal vectors, transform the same as the basis
vector columns. In the simple case in which, for example, thebasis vector~e
1
′
trans-
forms into
1
2
×~e
1
, the coordinate of this object must then also
1
2
times as large. This
is precisely what happens to the coordinates of a gradient ofa scalar function! The
reason is that such a gradient is the difference of the function per unit distance in
the direction of the basis vector. When this ‘unit’ suddenlyshrinks (i.e. if the basis
vector shrinks) this means that the gradient must shrink too(see Fig.
??for a one-
dimensional example). A ‘gradient’, which we so far have always regarded as a true
vector, will from now on be called a ‘covariant vector’ or ‘covector’: it transforms in
the same way as the basis vector columns.
The fact that gradients have usually been treated as ordinary vectors is that if
the coordinate transformation transforms one cartesian coordinate system into the
other (or in other words: one orthonormal basis into the other), then the matricesΛ
en(Λ
−1
)
T
are the same.
◮

As long as one transforms only between orthonormal basis, there is no difference
between contravariant vectors and covariant vectors. However, it is not always pos-
sible in practice to restrict oneself to such bases. When doing vector mathematics in

curved coordinate systems (like polar coordinates for example), one is often forced
to use non-orthonormal bases. And in special relativity oneis fundamentally forced
to distinguish between co- and contravariant vectors.
2.2. Mathematical approach
Now that we have a notion for the difference between the transformation of a vector
and the transformation of a gradient, let us have a more mathematical look at this.
Consider ann-dimensional manifold with coordinatesx
1
,x
2
, ...,x
n
. We define
the gradient of a functionf(x
1
,x
2
, ...,x
n
),
(∇f)
m
:=
∂f
∂x
m
.(2.5)
The difference in transformation will now be demonstrated using the simplest of
transformations: a homogeneous linear transformation (wedid this in the previous
section already, since we described all transformations with matrices). In general a
coordinate transformation can also be non-homogeneous linear, (e.g. a translation),
but we will not go into this here.
Suppose we have a vector field defined on this manifoldV:~v=~v(~x). Let us
perform a homogeneous linear transformation of the coordinates:
x
′
m
=A
mν
x
ν
.(2.6)
In this case not only the coordinatesx
m
change (and therefore the dependence of~v
on the coordinates), but also the components of the vectors,
v
′
m
(~x) =A
mν
v
ν
(~x),(2.7)
whereAis the same matrix as in Eq. (
2.6) (this may look trivial, but it is useful to
check it! Also note that we take as transformation matrix thematrix that describes
the transformation of the vector components, whereas in theprevious section we
took forΛthe matrix that describes the transformation of the basis vectors. SoAis
equal to(Λ
−1
)

).
Now take the functionf(x

, ...,x

)and the gradientw

This describes how a gradient transforms. One can regard thepartial derivative

as the matrix(A

whereAis defined as in Eq. (
2.6). To see this we first take the
inverse of Eq. (2.6):
x

the last term on the right-hand side

The indices are now in the correct position to put this in matrix form,
w

(We again note that the matrixAused here denotes the coordinate transformation
from the coordinatesxto the coordinatesx
′
).
We have shown here what is the difference in the transformation properties of
normal vectors (‘arrows’) and gradients. Normal vectors wecall from now oncon-
travariant vectors(though we usually simply call themvectors) and gradients we call
covariant vectors(orcovectorsorone-forms). It should be noted that not every covari-
ant vector field can be constructed as a gradient of a scalar function. A gradient has
the property that∇ ×(∇f) =0, while not all covector fields may have this prop-
erty. To distinguish vectors from covectors we will denote vectors with an arrow
(~v) and covectors with a tilde (
 ̃
w). To make further distinction between contravari-
ant and covariant vectors we will put the contravariant indices (i.e. the indices of
contravariant vectors) assuperscriptand the covariant indices (i.e. the indices of co-
variant vectors) withsubscripts,
y
α
: contravariant vector
w
α
: covariant vector, or covector
12

2.2 Mathematical approach
In practice it will turn out to be very useful to also introduce this convention for
matrices. Without further argumentation (this will be given later) we note that the
matrixAcan be written as:
A:A
m
ν
.(2.19)
The transposed version of this matrix is:
A
T
:A
ν
m
.(2.20)
With this convention the transformation rules for vectors resp. covectors become

The deltaδof Eq. (

This is called the ‘Kronecker delta’. It simply has the ‘function’ of ‘renaming’ an

Introduction to tensors
Tensor calculus is a technique that can be regarded as a follow-up on linear algebra.
It is a generalisation of classical linear algebra. In classical linear algebra one deals
with vectors and matrices. Tensors are generalisations of vectors and matrices, as
we will see in this chapter.
In section
3.1we will see in an example how a tensor can naturally arise. In
section
3.2we will re-analyse the essential step of section3.1, to get a better under-
standing.
3.1. The new inner product and the first tensor
The inner product is very important in physics. Let us consider an example. In
classical mechanics it is true that the ‘work’ that is done when an object is moved
equals the inner product of the force acting on the object andthe displacement vector
~x,
W=h
~
F,~xi.(3.1)
The workWmust of course be independent of the coordinate system in which the
vectors
~
Fand~xare expressed. The inner product as we know it,
s=h~a,

bi=a

(old definition)(3.2)
does not have this property in general,

form the kronecker deltaδ

. It appears as if the inner product only describes the
physics correctly in a special kind of coordinate system: a system which according to
our human perception is ‘rectangular’, and has physical units, i.e. a distance of 1 in

-direction. An orthonormal transformation
produces again such a rectangular ‘physical’ coordinate system. If one has so far
always employed such special coordinates anyway, this inner product has always
worked properly.
However, as we already explained in the previous chapter, itis not always guar-
anteed that one can use such special coordinate systems (polar coordinates are an
example in which thelocalorthonormal basis of vectors is not the coordinate basis).

two contravariant vectors which also has this invariance property. To do this we

(Warning:later it will become clear that this definition is not quite useful, but at
least it will bring us on the right track toward finding an invariant inner product be-
tween two contravariant vectors). The inner productswill now obviously transform
correctly, because it is made out of two invariant ones,

We have now produced an invariant ‘inner product’ for contravariant vectors by
using a covariant vectorw

To achieve this,gmust become, in an orthonormal system, something like a unit

One can see that one cannot produce this set of numbers according to Eq. (
3.9).
This means that the definition of the inner product accordingto Eq. (3.6) has to be
rejected (hence the warning that was written there). Instead we have to start directly
from Eq. (
3.10). We do no longer regardgas built out of two covectors, but regard it
as a matrix-like set of numbers on itself.
However, it does not have the transformation properties of aclassical matrix.
Remember that the matrixAof the previous chapter had one index up and one
index down:A
m
ν
, indicating that it has mixed contra- and co-variant transformation
properties. The new objectg
mν
, however, has both indices down: it transforms in
both indices in a covariant way, like thew
m
w
ν
which we initially used for our inner
product. This curious object, which looks like a matrix, butdoes not transform as
one, is an example of atensor. A matrix is also a tensor, as are vectors and covectors.
Matrices, vectors and covectors are special cases of the more general class of objects
called ‘tensors’. The objectg
mν
is a kind of tensor that is neither a matrix nor a vector
or covector. It is a new kind of object for which only tensor mathematics has a proper
description.
The objectgis called ametric, and we will study its properties later in more
detail: in Chapter
5.
With this last step we now have a complete description of the new inner product
between contravariant vectors that behaves properly, in that it remains invariant
under any linear transformation, and that it reproduces theold inner product when
we work in an orthonormal basis. So, returning to our original problem,

In this section we have in fact put forward two new concepts: the new inner
product and the concept of a ‘tensor’. We will cover both concepts more deeply: the
tensors in Section
3.2and Chapter4, and the inner product in Chapter5.
3.2. Creating tensors from vectors
In the previous section we have seen how one can produce a tensor out of two
covectors. In this section we will revisit this procedure from a slightly different
angle.
Let us look at products between matrices and vectors, like wedid in the previous
chapters. One starts with an object with two indices and thereforen
2
components
(the matrix) and an object with one index and thereforencomponents (the vector).
Together they haven
2
+ncomponenten. After multiplication one is left with one
object with one index andncomponents (a vector). One has therefore lost(n
2
+
n)−n=n
2
numbers: they are ‘summed away’. A similar story holds for the inner
product between a covector and a vector. One starts with 2ncomponents and ends
up with one number,
s=x
m
y
m
=x
1
y
1
+x
2
y

+x
3
y

.(3.14)
Summation therefore reduces the number of components.
In standard multiplication procedures from classical linear algebra such a sum-
mation usually takes place: for matrix multiplications as well as for inner products.
In index notation this is denoted with paired indices using the summation conven-
tion. However, the index notation also allows us to multiplyvectors and covectors
17

3.2 Creating tensors from vectors
withoutpairing up the indices, and therefore without summation. The object one
thus obtains does not have fewer components, butmore:

We now did not produce one number (as we would have if we replacedνwithmin
the above formula) but instead an ordered set of numbers labelled with the indicesm
andν. So if we take the example~x= (1, 3, 5)and
 ̃
y= (4, 7, 6), then the tensor-
components ofs

This is the kind of ‘tensor’ object that this booklet is about. However, this ob-
ject still looks very much like a matrix, since a matrix is also nothing more or less
than a set of numbers labeled with two indices. To check if this is a true matrix or
something else, we need to see how it transforms,

If we compare the transformation in Eq.(

The difference withs

lies in the first matrix of the transformation equation. Fors
it is the transformation matrix for contravariant vectors,while fortit is the trans-
formation matrix for covariant vectors. The tensortis clearlynota matrix, so we
indeed created something new here. Thegtensor of the previous section is of the
same type ast.
The beauty of tensors is that they can have an arbitrary number of indices. One
can also produce, for instance, a tensor with 3 indices,

.(3.19)
This is an ordered set of numbes labeled with three indices. It can be visualized as a
kind of ‘super-matrix’ in 3 dimensions (see Fig.
??).
These are tensors ofrank 3, as opposed to tensors of rank 0 (scalars), rank 1
(vectors and covectors) and rank 2 (matrices and the other kind of tensors we in-
troduced so far). We can distinguish between the contravariant rank and covariant
rank. ClearlyA
αβγ
is a tensor of covariant rank 3 and contravariant rank 0. Its to-
tal rank is 3. One can also produce tensors of, for instance, contravariant rank 2

α

, is also of
contravariant rank 2 and covariant rank 3. Typically, when tensor mathematics is
applied, the meaning of each index has been defined beforehand: the first index
means this, the second means that etc. As long as this is well-defined, then one can
have co- and contra-variant indices in any order. However, since it usuallylooks bet-
ter(though this is a matter of taste) to have the contravariant indices first and the
covariant ones last, usually the meaning of the indices is chosen in such a way that
this is accomodated. This is just a matter of how one chooses to assign meaning to
each of the indices.
Again it must be clear that although a multiplication (without summation!) ofm
vectors andmcovectors produces a tensor of rankm+n,not every tensor of rank m+
n can be constructed as such a product. Tensors are much more general than these
simple products of vectors and covectors. It is therefore important to step away
from this picture of combining vectors and covectors into a tensor, and consider this
construction as nothing more than a simple example.

Tensors, definitions and properties
Now that we have a first idea of what tensors are, it is time for amore formal de-
scription of these objects.
We begin with a formal definition of a tensor in Section
4.1. Then, Sections4.2
and4.3give some important mathematical properties of tensors. Section4.4gives
an alternative, in the literature often used, notation of tensors. And finally, in Sec-
tion
4.5, we take a somewhat different view, considering tensors as operators.
4.1. Definition of a tensor
‘Definition’ of a tensor: An(N,M)-tensor at a given point in space can be described
by a set of numbers withN+Mindices which transforms, upon coordinate trans-
formation given by the matrixA, in the following way:
t

(4.1)
An(N,M)-tensor in a three-dimensional manifold therefore has 3
(N+M)
compo-
nents. It is contravariant inNcomponents and covariant inMcomponents. Tensors
of the type
t
α
β
γ
(4.2)
are of course not excluded, as they can be constructed from the above kind of tensors
by rearrangement of indices (like the transposition of a matrix as in Eq.
2.20).
Matrices (2 indices), vectors and covectors (1 index) and scalars (0 indices) are
therefore also tensors, where the latter transforms ass
′
=s.
4.2. Symmetry and antisymmetry
In practice it often happens that tensors display a certain amount of symmetry, like
what we know from matrices. Such symmetries have a strong effect on the proper-
ties of these tensors. Often many of these properties or eventensor equations can be
derived solely on the basis of these symmetries.
A tensortis calledsymmetricin the indicesmandνif the components are equal
upon exchange of the index-values. So, for a 2
nd
rank contravariant tensor,
t
mν
=t
νm
symmetric (2,0)-tensor.(4.3)
21

4.4 Tensors as geometrical objects
A tensortis calledanti-symmetricin the indicesmandνif the components are equal-
but-opposite upon exchange of the index-values. So, for a 2
nd
rank contravariant
tensor,
t
mν
=−t
νm
anti-symmetric (2,0)-tensor.(4.4)
It is not useful to speak of symmetry or anti-symmetry in a pair of indices that are
not of the same type (co- or contravariant). The properties of symmetry only remain
invariant upon basis transformation if the indices are of the same type.

Exercises
2and3of SectionC.4.
4.3. Contraction of indices
With tensors of at least one covariant and at least one contravariant index we can
define a kind of ‘internal inner product’. In the simplest case this goes as,
t
α
α
,(4.5)
where, as usual, we sum overα. This is the trace of the matrixt
α
β
. Also this con-
struction is invariant under basis transformations. In classical linear algebra this
property of the trace of a matrix was also known.
◮
Exercise
3of SectionC.4.
One can also perform such acontraction of indiceswith tensors of higher rank, but
then some uncontracted indices remain, e.g.
t
αβ
α
=v
β
,(4.6)
In this way we can convert a tensor of type(N,M)into a tensor of type(N−1,M−
1). Of course, this contraction procedure causes informationto get lost, since after
the contraction we have fewer components.
Note that contraction can only take place between one contravariant index and
one covariant index. A contraction liket
αα
is not invariant under coordinate trans-
formation, and we should therefore reject such constructions. In fact, the summa-
tions of the summation conventiononlyhappen over a covariant and a contravariant
index, be it a contraction of a tensor (liket
mα
α
) or an inner product between two ten-
sors (liket
mα
y
αν
).
4.4. Tensors as geometrical objects
Vectors can be seen as columns of numbers, but also as arrows.One can perform
calculations with these arrows if one regards them as linearcombinations of ‘basis
arrows’,
~v=
∑
m
v
m
~e
m
.(4.7)
We would like to do something like this also with covectors and eventually of course
with all tensors. For covectors it amounts to constructing aset of ‘unit covectors’ that
serve as a basis for the covectors. We write
 ̃
w=
∑
m
w
m
 ̃
e
m
.(4.8)
Note: we denote the basis vectors and basis covectors with indices, but we do not
mean the components of these basis (co-)vectors (after all:in which basis would that
22

4.4 Tensors as geometrical objects
be?). Instead we label the basis (co-)vectors themselves with these indices. This way
of writing was already introduced in Section
2.1. In spite of the fact that these indices
have therefore a slightly different meaning, we still use the usual conventions of
summation for these indices. Note that we mark the co-variant basis vectors with
anupperindex and the contra-variant basis-vectors with alowerindex. This may
sound counter-intuitive (‘did we not decide to use upper indices for contra-variant
vectors?’) but this is precisely what we mean with the ‘different meaning of the
indices’ here: this time theylabelthe vectors and do not denote their components.
The next step is to express the basis of covectors in the basisof vectors. To do this,
let us remember that the inner product between a vector and a covector is always
invariant under transformations, independent of the chosen basis:
~v
 ̃
w=v
α
w
α
(4.9)
We now substitute Eq. (
4.7) and Eq. (4.8) into the left hand side of the equation,
~v
 ̃
w=v
α
~e

w
β
 ̃

If Eq. (
4.9) and Eq. (4.10) have to remain consistent, it automatically follows that
 ̃
e
β
~e
α
=δ
β
α
.(4.11)
On the left hand side one has the inner product between a covector
 ̃
e
β
and a vec-
tor~e
α
. This time the inner product is written in abstract form (i.e. not written out
in components like we did before). The indicesαandβsimply denote which of
the basis covectors (β) is contracted with which of the basis vectors (α). A geomet-
rical representation of vectors, covectors and the geometric meaning of their inner
product is given in appendix
B.
Eq. (4.11) is the (implicit) definition of the co-basis in terms of the basis. This
equation does not give the co-basis explicitly, but it defines it nevertheless uniquely.
This co-basis is called the ‘dual basis’. By arranging the basis covectors in columns
as in Section
2.1, one can show that they transform as
 ̃
e
′α
=A
α
β
 ̃

)
T
)
α
β
~e
β
.(4.13)
In other words: basis-covector-columns transform as vectors, in contrast to basis-
vector-columns, which transform as covectors.
The description of vectors and covectors as geometric objects is now complete.
We can now also express tensors in such an abstract way (againhere we refer to
the mathematical description; a geometric graphical depiction of tensors is given in
appendix
B). We then express these tensors in terms of ‘basis tensors’.These can be
constructed from the basis vectors and basis covectors we have constructed above,
t=t

The operator⊗is the ‘tensor outer product’. Combining tensors (in this case the
basis (co-)vectors) with such an outer product means that the rank of the resulting
tensor is the sum of the ranks of the combined tensors. It is the geometric (abstract)
version of the ‘outer product’ we introduced in Section
3.2to create tensors. The
operator⊗is not commutative,

4.5 Tensors as operators
4.5. Tensors as operators
Let us revisit the new inner product withva vector andwa covector,
w
α
v
α
=s.(4.16)
If we drop index notation and we use the usual symbols we have,
 ̃
w~v=s,(4.17)
This could also be written as
 ̃
w(~v) =s,(4.18)
where the brackets mean that the covector
 ̃
w actson the vector~v. In this way,
 ̃
wis an
operator (a function) which ‘eats’ a vector and produces a scalar. Therefore, written
in the usual way to denote maps from one set to another,
 ̃
w:R
n
→R.(4.19)
A covector is then called a linear ‘function of direction’: the result of the operation
(i.e. the resulting scalar) is linearly dependent on the input (the vector), which is a
directional object. We can also regard it the other way around,
~v(
 ̃
w) =s.(4.20)
where the vector is now the operator and the covector the argument. To prevent
confusion we write Eq. (
4.19) from now on in a somewhat different way,
~v:R
∗
3
→R.(4.21)
An arbitrary tensor of rank(N,M)can also be regarded in this way. The tensor
has as input a tensor of rank(M,N), or the product of more than one tensors of
lower rank, such that the number of contravariant indices equalsMand the number
of covariant indices equalsN. After contraction of all indices we obtain a scalar.
Example (for a(2, 1)-tensor),
t
αβ
γ
a
α
b
β
c
γ
=s.(4.22)
The tensortcan be regarded as a function of 2 covectors (aanb) and 1 vector (c),
which produces a real number (scalar). The function is linearly dependent on its
input, so that we can call this a ‘multilinear function of direction’. This somewhat
complex nomenclature for tensors is mainly found in older literature.
Of course the fact that tensors can be regarded to some degreeas functions or
operators does not mean that it is always useful to do so.  In most applications
tensors are considered as objects themselves, and not as functions.

The metric tensor and the new inner
product
In this chapter we will go deeper into the topic of the new inner product. The new
inner product, and the metric tensorgassociated with it, is of great importance to
nearly all applications of tensor mathematics in non-cartesian coordinate systems
and/or curved manifolds. It allows us to produce mathematical and physical for-
mulae that are invariant under coordinate transformationsof any kind.
In Section
5.1we will give an outline of the role that is played by the metric
tensorgin geometry. Section
5.2covers the properties of this metric tensor. Finally,
Section5.3describes the procedure of raising or lowering an index using the metric
tensor.
5.1. The metric as a measuring rod
If one wants to describe a physical system, then one typically wants to do this with
numbers, because they are exact and one can put them on paper.To be able to do this
one must first define a coordinate system in which the measurements can be done.
One could in principle take the coordinate system in any way one likes, but often
one prefers to use an orthonormal coordinate system becausethis is particularly
practical for measuring distances using the law of Pythagoras.
However, often it is not quite practical to use such cartesian coordinates. For
systems with (nearly) cylindrical symmetry or (nearly) spherical symmetry, for in-
stance, it is much more practical to use cylindrical or polarcoordinates, even though
onecoulduse cartesian ones. In some applications it is even impossible to use or-
thonormal coordinates, for instance in the case of mapping of the surface of the
Earth. In a typical projection of the Earth with meridians vertically and parallels
horizontally, the northern countries are stretched enormously and the north/south
pole is a line instead of a point. Measuring distances (or thelength of a vector) on
such a map with Pythagoras would produce wrong results.
What one has to do to get an impression of ‘true’ distances, sizes and propor-
tions is to draw on various places on the Earth-map a ‘unit circle’ that represents,
say, 100 km in each direction (if we wish to measure distancesin units of 100 km).
At the equator these are presumably circles, but as one goes toward the pole they
tend to become ellipses: they are circles that are stretchedin horizonal (east-west)
direction. At the north pole such a ‘unit circle’ will be stretched infinitely in hori-
zontal direction. There is a strong relation between this unit circle and the metricg.
In appendix
Bone can see that indeed a metric can be graphically represented with

5.2 Properties of the metric tensor
a unit circle (in 2-D) or a unit sphere (in 3-D).
So how does one measure the distance between two points on such a curved
manifold? In the example of the Earth’s projection one sees thatgis different at dif-
ferent lattitudes. So if points A and B have different lattitudes, there is no uniqueg
that we can use to measure the distance. Indeed, there is no objective distance that
one can give. What what can do is to define a path from point A to point B and mea-
sure the distance along this path in little steps. At each step the distance travelled is
so small that one can take thegat the middle of the step and get a reasonably good
estimate of the lengthdsof that step. This is given by

(~x).(5.1)
By integratingdsall the way from A to B one thus obtains the distancealong this
path. Perhaps the ‘true’ distance is then the distance along the path which yields the
shortest distance between these points.
What we have done here is to chop the path into such small bits that the curva-
ture of the Earth is negligible. Within each stepgchanges so little that one can use
the linear expressions for length and distance using the local metricg.
Let us take a bit more concrete example and measure distancesin 3-D using
polar coordinates. From geometric considerations we know that the length dlof an
infinitesimally small vector at position(r,θ,φ)in polar coordinates satisfies

All the information about the concept of ‘length’ or ‘distance’ is hidden in the metric
tensorg. The metric tensor fieldg(~x)is usually called the ‘metric of the manifold’.
5.2. Properties of the metric tensor
The metric tensorghas some important properties. First of all, it is symmetric. This
can be seen in various ways. One of them is that one can always find a coordinate
system in which, locally, the metric tensor has the shape of aunit ‘matrix’, which is
symmetric. Symmetry of a tensor is conserved upon any transformation (see Sec-
tion
4.2). Another way to see it is that the inner product of two vectors should not
depend on the order of these vectors:g
mν
v
m
w
ν
=g
mν
v
ν
w
m
≡g
νm
v
m
w
ν
(in the last
step we renamed the running indices).
Every symmetric second rank covariant tensor can be transformed into diagonal
form in which the diagonal elements are either 1,0 or−1. For the metric tensor they
will then all be 1: in an orthonormal coordinate system. In fact, an orthonormal
coordinate system isdefinedas the coordinate system in whichg
mν
=diag(1, 1, 1).
A normal metric can always be put into this form. However, mathematically one
could also conceive a manifold that has a metric that can be brought into the follow-
ing form:g
mν
=diag(1, 1,−1). This produces funny results for some vectors. For
instance, the vector(0, 0, 1)would have an imaginary length, and the vector(0, 1, 1)
has length zero. These are rather pathological properties and appear to be only in-
teresting to mathematicians. A real metric, after all, should always produce positive
definite lengths for vectors unequal to the zero-vector. However, as one can see in
appendix
A, in special relativity a metric will be introduced that can be brought to
26

5.3 Co versus contra
the form diag(−1, 1, 1, 1). For now, however, we will assume that the metric is posi-
tive definite (i.e. can be brought to the formg
mν
=diag(1, 1, 1)through a coordinate
transformation).
It should be noted that a metric of signatureg
mν
=diag(1, 1,−1)canneverbe
brought into the formg
mν
=diag(1, 1, 1)by coordinate transformation, and vice
versa. This signature of the metric is therefore an invariant. Normal metrics have
signature diag(1, 1, 1). This does not mean that theyare g
mν
=diag(1, 1, 1), but they
can be brought into this form with a suitable coordinate transformation.
◮
Exercise
1of SectionC.5.
So what about the inner product between twoco-vectors? Just as with the vectors
we use a kind of metric tensor, but this time ofcontravariantnature:g
mν
. The inner
product then becomes
s=g
mν
x
m
y
ν
.(5.4)
The distinction between these two metric tensors is simply made by upper resp. lower
indices. The properties we have derived forg
mν
of course also hold forg
mν
. And both
metrics are intimitely related: onceg
mν
is given,g
mν
can be constructed and vice
versa. In a sense they are two realisations of the same metricobjectg. The easiest
way to findg
mν
fromg
mν
is to find a coordinate system in whichg
mν
=diag(1, 1, 1):
theng
mν
is also equal to diag(1, 1, 1). But in the next section we will derive a more
elegant relation between the two forms of the metric tensor.
5.3. Co versus contra
Before we got introduced to co-vectors we presumably alwaysused orthonormal
coordinate systems. In such coordinate systems we never encountered the differ-
ence between co- and contra-variant vectors. A gradient wassimply a vector, like
any kind of vector. An example is the electric field. One can regard an electric field
as a gradient,

E=−∇V⇔E

.(5.5)
On the other hand it is clearly also an arrow-like object, related to a force,

.(5.6)
In an orthonormal system one can interchange
~
Rand
 ̃
R(or equivalentlyE
m
andE
m
)
without punishment. But as soon as we go to a non-orthonormalsystem, we will
encounter problems. Then one is suddenly forced to distinguish between the two.
So the question becomes: if one has a potential fieldV, how does one obtain the
contravariant
~
E? Perhaps the most obvious solution is: first produce the covariant
tensor
 ̃
E, then transform to an orthonormal system, then switch from co-vector form
to contravariant vector form (in this system their components are identical, at least
for a positive definite metric) and then transform back to theoriginal coordinate
system. This is possible, but very time-consuming and unwieldy. A better method
is to use the metric tensor:
E
m
=g
mν
E
ν
.(5.7)
This is a proper tensor product, as the contraction takes place over an upper and a
lower index. The objectE
m
, which was created fromE
ν
is now contravariant. One
can see that this vector must indeed be the contravariant version ofE
ν
by taking an
orthonormal coordinate system: hereg
mν
=diag(1, 1, 1), i.e.g
mν
is some kind of unit
27

5.3 Co versus contra
‘matrix’. This is the same as saying that in the orthonormal basisE
m
=E
ν
, which is
indeed true (again, only for a metric that can be diagonalised to diag(1, 1, 1), which
for classical physics is always the case). However, in contrast to the formulaE
m
=
E
ν
, the formula Eq. (
5.7) is now also valid after transformation to any coordinate
system,

(here we introducedσto avoid having fourνsymbols, which would conflict with
the summation convention). If we multiply on both sides withA

we obtain exactly
(the indexρcan be of course replaced bym) Eq. (
5.7).
One can of course also do the reverse,
E
m
=g
mν

.(5.9)
If we first lower an index withg
νρ

mν

arrive back with the original vector. This results in a relation betweeng

With this relation we have now defined the contravariant version of the metric ten-
sor in terms of its covariant version.
We call the conversion of a contravariant index into a covariant one “lowering an
index”, while the reverse is “raising an index”. The vector and its covariant version
are each others “dual”.

Tensor calculus
Now that we are familiar with the concept of ‘tensor’ we need to go a bit deeper in
the calculus that one can do with these objects. This is not entirely trivial. The index
notation makes it possible to write all kinds of manipulations in an easy way, but
makes it also all too easy to write down expressions that haveno meaning or have
bad properties. We will need to investigate where these pitfalls may arise.
We will also start thinking about differentiation of tensors. Also here the rules of
index notation are rather logical, but also here there are problems looming. These
problems have to do with the fact that ordinary derivatives of tensors do no longer
transform as tensors. This is a problem that has far-reaching consequences and we
will deal with them in Chapter
7. For now we will merely make a mental note of
this.
At the end of this chapter we will introduce another special kind of tensor, the
Levi-Civita tensor, which allows us to write down cross-products in index notation.
Without this tensor the cross-product cannot be expressed in index notation.
6.1. The ‘covariance’ of equations
In chapter
3we saw that the old inner product was not a good definition. It said
that the work equals the (old) inner product between
~
Fen~x. However, while the
work is a physical notion, and thereby invariant under coordinate transformation,
the inner product was not invariant. In other words: the equation was only valid in
a prefered coordinate system. After the introduction of thenew inner product the
equation suddenly kept its validity in any coordinate system. We call this ‘universal
validity’ of the equation: ‘covariance. Be careful not to confuse this with ‘covariant
vector’: it is a rather unpractical fate that the word ‘covariant’ has two meanings
in tensor calculus: that of the type of index (or vector) on the one hand and the
‘universal validity’ of expressions on the other hand.
The following expressions and equations are therefore covariant,
x
m
=y
m
,(6.1)
x
m
=y
m
,(6.2)
because both sides transform in the same way. The following expression isnotco-
variant:
x
m
=y
m
,(6.3)
because the left-hand-side transforms as a covector (i.e. with(A
−1
)
T
)) and the right-
hand-side as a contravariant vector (i.e. withA). If this equation holdsby chancein
29

6.2 Addition of tensors
one coordinate system, then it will likelynothold in another coordinate system.
Since we are only interested in vectors and covectors aregeometric objectsand not
in their components in some arbitrary coordinate system, wemust conclude that
covectors cannot be set equal to contravariant vectors.
The same as above we can say about the following equation,
t
mν
=s
m
ν
.(6.4)
This expression is also not covariant. The tensors on both sides of the equal sign are
of different type.
If we choose to stay in orthonormal coordinatesthen we can drop the distinction be-
tween co- and contra-variant vectors and we do not need to check if our expressions
or equations are covariant. In that case we put all indices assubscript, to avoid
giving the impression that we distinguish between co- and contravariant vectors.
6.2. Addition of tensors
Two tensors can only be added if they have the same rank: one cannot add a vector
to a matrix. Addition of two equal-rank tensors is only possible if they are of the
same type. So
v
m
+w
m
(6.5)
is not a tensor. (The fact that the indexmoccurs double here does not mean that
they need to be summed over, since according to the summationconvention one
only sums over equal indices occuring in a product, not in a sum. See chapter
1). If
one adds two equal type tensors but with unequal indices one gets a meaningless
expression,
v
m
+w
ν
.(6.6)
If tensors are of the same type, one can add them. One should thenchoosethe indices
to be the same,
x
mν
+y
mν
,(6.7)
or
x
αβ
+y
αβ
.(6.8)
Both the above expressions areexactlythe same. We just chosemandνas the indices
in the first expression andαandβin the second. This is merely a matter of choice.
Now what about the following expression:
t
α
β
γ
+r
αγ
β
.(6.9)
Both tensors are of same rank, have the same number of upper and lower indices,
but their order is different. This is a rather peculiar contruction, since typically (as
mentioned before) one assigns meaning to each index before one starts working
with tensors.  Evidently the meaning assigned to index 2 is different in the two
cases, since in the case oft
α
β
γ
it is a covariant index while in the case ofr
αγ
β
it is
a contravariant index. But this expression, though highly confusing (and therefore
not recommendable) is not formally wrong. One can see this ifone assumes that
r
αγ
β
=u
α
v
γ
w
β
. It is formally true thatu
α
v
γ
w
β
=u
α
w
β
v
γ
, because multiplication
is commutative. The problem is, that a tensor has only meaning for the user if one
can, beforehand, assign meaning to each of the indices (i.e.”first index means this,
second index means that...”). This will be confused if one mixes the indices up.
Fortunately, in most applications of tensors the meaning ofthe indices will be clear
from the context. Often symmetries of the indices will help in avoiding confusion.

6.4 First order derivatives: non-covariant version
6.3. Tensor products
The most important property of the product between two tensors is:
The result of a product between tensors is again a tensor if ineach summation
the summation takes place over one upper index and one lower index.
According to this rule, the following objects are thereforenot tensors, and we will
forbid them from now on:
x
m
T
mν
,h
α
β
γ
t
α
β
γ
.(6.10)
The following productsaretensors,
x
m
T
mν
h

α
β
γ
.(6.11)
and the following expression is a covariant expression:
t
mν
=a
mρ
σ
b
νσ
ρ
.(6.12)
If we nevertheless want to sum over two covariant indices or two contravariant
indices, then this is possible with the use of the metric tensor. For instance: an inner
product betweent
mν
env
ν
could look like:
w
m
=g
αβ
t
mα
v
β
.(6.13)
The metric tensor is then used as a kind of ‘glue’ between two indices over which
one could normally not sum because they are of the same kind.
6.4. First order derivatives: non-covariant version
Up to now we have mainly concerned ourselves with the properties of individual
tensors.  In differential geometry one usually usestensor fields, where the tensor
depends on the location given by~x. One can now take the derivative of such tensor
fields and these derivatives can also be denoted with index notation. We will see in
Chapter
7that in curved coordinates or in curved manifols, these derivatives will
not behave as tensors and are not very physically meaningful. But for non-curved
coordinates on a flat manifold this problem does not arise. Inthis section we will
therefore, temporarily, avoid this problem by assuming non-curved coordinates on
a flat manifold.
We start with the gradient of a scalar field, which we already know,
(gradf)
m
=
∂f
∂x
m
.(6.14)
In a similar fashion we can now define the ‘gradient’ of a vector field:
(grad~v)
m
ν
=
∂v
m
∂x
ν
,(6.15)
or of a tensor-field,
(gradt)
mνα
=
∂t
mν
∂x
α
.(6.16)
As long as we employ only linear transformations, the above objects are all tensors.
Now let us introduce an often used notation,

6.5. Rot, cross-products and the permutation symbol
A useful set of numbers, used for instance in electrodynamics, is the permutation
symbolǫ. It is a set of numbers with three indices, if we work in a 3-dimensional
space, ornindices if we work inn-dimensional space.
The objectǫdoes not transform entirely like a tensor (though almost), and it is
therefore not considered a true tensor. In fact it is atensor density(orpseudo tensor),
which is a near cousin of the tensor family. Tensor densitiestransform as tensors, but
are additionally multiplied by a power of the Jacobian determinant of the transfor-
mation matrix. However, to avoid these complexities, we will in this section assume
an orthonormal basis, and forget for the moment about covariance.
Theǫsymbol is completely anti-symmetric,
ǫ
ijk
=−ǫ
jik
=−ǫ
ikj
=−ǫ
kji
.(6.21)
If two of the three indices have then same value, then the above equation clearly
yields zero. The only elements ofǫthat are non-zero are those for which none of the
indices is equal to another. We usually define
ǫ
123
=1 ,(6.22)
and with Eq. (
6.21) all the other non-zero elements follow. Any permutation ofin-
dices yields a−1. As a summary,
ǫ
ijk


1    ifijkis an even permutation of 123,
−1  ifijkis an odd permutation of 123,
0    if two indices are equal.

This pseudo-tensor is often called the Levi-Civita pseudo-tensor.

Covariant derivatives
One of the (many) reasons why tensor calculus is so useful is that it allows a proper
description of physically meaningful derivatives of vectors. We have not mentioned
this before, but taking a derivative of a vector (or of any tensor for that matter) is
a non-trivial thing if one wants to formulate it in a covariant way. As usual, in a
rectangular orthonormal coordinate system this is usuallynot an issue. But when
the coordinates are curved (like in polar coordinates, for example) then this becomes
a big issue. It is even more of an issue when the manifold is curved (like in general
relativity), but this is beyond the scope of this booklet – even though the techniques
we will discuss in this chapter will be equally well applicable for curved manifolds.
We want to construct a derivative of a vector in such a way thatit makes physical
sense even in the case of curved coordinates. One may ask: whyis there a problem?
We will show this by a simple example in Section??. In this section we will also
show how one defines vectors in curved coordinates by using a local set of basis
vectors derived from the coordinate system. In Section??we will introduce without
proof the mathematical formula for a covariant derivative,and introduce thereby
the so-called Christoffel symbol. In Section??we will return to the polar coordinates
to demonstrate how this machinery works in practice.
This chapter will, however, take quite large steps. The reason is that the concepts
of covariant derivatives are usually described in detail inintroductory literature
on general relativity and Riemannian geometry. In principle this is well beyond
the scope of this booklet. However, since tensors find much oftheir application in
problems in which differential operators are used, we wish to at least briefly address
the concept of covariant derivative. For further details werefer to***************
LITERATURE LIST **************
7.1. Vectors in curved coordinates
Defining vectors in curvilinear coordinates is not trivial.Since the coordinates are
curved (maybe even the manifold itself is curved, like the surface of the Earth), there
is no meaningful global set of basis vectors in which one can express the vectors. If
a vector or tensor field is given, then at each location this vector or tensor could
be decomposed into thelocalbasis (co-)vectors. This basis may be different from
location to location, but we always assume that the changes are smooth.
In principle there are two useful set of basis vectors one canchoose:
1.A local orthonormal set of basis vectors: If the coordinates are such that they are
locally perpendicular with respect to each other, then it ispossible to choose
35

7.2 The covariant derivative of a vector/tensor field
the basis vectors such that they point along these coordinates (though not nec-
essarily are normalized the same as the coordinate units).
2.A local coordinate basis: The covector basis can be seen as unit steps in each of
the directions:
 ̃
e
m
=dx
m
. The contravariant basis vectors are then~e
m
=∂/∂x
m
.
Typically this coordinate basis is not orthonormal.
So far in the entire booklet we have implicitly assumed a local coordinate basis (re-
member that we used the words coordinate transformation on equal footing as basis
transformation). For tensor mathematics this basis is usually the easiest to use. But
in realistic applications (like in Chapter??) a local orthonormal basis has more phys-
ical meaning. In the application of Chapter??we will first convert everything to the
coordinate basis in order to do the tensor math, and then, once the final answer is
there, we will convert back to the local orthonormal basis, which is physically more
intuitive. But since the tensor mathematics works best for the local coordinate basis,
we will assume this basis for the rest of this chapter.
Now let us take the example of circular coordinates in two dimensions. We can
express the usualx- andy-coordinates in terms ofrandφas:x=rcosφandy=
rsinφ. Inr-direction the coordinate basis vector∂/∂rcan act as a normal basis
vector. In theφ-direction, however, the coordinate basis vector∂/∂φhas a different
length at different radii. However,
1
r
∂/∂φis again a normalized (unit) vector. The
set of basis vectors(∂/∂r,∂/∂φ)is the local coordinate basis, while the set of basis
vectors(∂/∂r,
1
r
∂/∂φ)is a local orthonormal basis, which happens to be parallel to
the coordinates.
Now let us use the coordinate basis. Let us take a vector field that, at every
location, when expressed in this local basis, takes the form(1, 0). This is shown in
Fig.XXXX. Expressed in cartesian coordinates (for which a global basis is possible)
this would be a vector field(x/
p

2
+y

,y/

not constant. In cartesian coordinates one would write, forinstance,

which is clearly non-zero. However, if we switch to circularcoordinates, and take
the derivative with respect to, for instance,φ, then we obtain zero,

.(7.2)
In the circular coordinate system itlooksas if the vector does not change in space,
but in reality it does. This is the problem one encounters with derivatives of tensors
in curved coordinates. Going to the local orthonormal basisdoes not help. One has
to define a new, ‘covariant’ form of the derivative.
7.2. The covariant derivative of a vector/tensor field
In this section we will introduce the covariant derivative of a vector field. We will
do sowithout proof. Again, for a more detailed discussion we refer to the literature.
We define∂
m
to be the ordinary coordinate-derivative∂/∂x
m
, and∇
m
to be the new
covariant derivative. The covariant derivative of a vector fieldv
m
is defined as
∇

whereΓ

is an object called theChristoffel symbol. The Christoffel symbol isnot
a tensor because it contains all the information about the curvature of the coordi-
nate system and can therefore be transformed entirely to zero if the coordinates are
36

7.2 The covariant derivative of a vector/tensor field
straightened. Nevertheless we treat it as any ordinary tensor in terms of the index
notation.
The Christoffel symbol can be computed from the metricg

From the exercise we can see that the above recipe indeed gives the correct an-
swer even in curved coordinates. We can also prove that the covariant derivative of
the metric itself is always zero.

Tensors in special relativity
Although tensors are mostly useful in general relativity, they are also quite conve-
nient in special relativity. Moreover, when we express the formulas using tensors,
they expose the structure of the theory much better than the formulas without ten-
sors do. We will start here at the point when four-vectors areintroduced into special
relativity.
From the simple thought experiments with moving trains, meant to give a visual
understanding of the Lorentz transformations, it has become clear that 3-dimensional
space and 1-dimensional time are not separate entities, butrather should be seen as
one. In matrix form one found for a pure Lorentz transformation

With the knowledge which we now have about the ‘metric tensor’, this formula can
be understood much better. Namely, we know that the inner product of two vectors
does not really exist (at least not in a form which is independent of the coordinate
system). Rather, we should be talking about the inner product of a vector with a
covector. We can obtain one from the other by raising or lowering an index, making
use of the metric tensor,

APPENDIX A. TENSORS IN SPECIAL RELATIVITY
Minkowski space, which is the space in which the rules of special relativity hold, is
thus a space which has a metric which is different from the metric in an ordinary
Euclidean space. In order to do computations in this space, we do not have to in-
troduce any strange inner products. Rather, we simply applyour new knowledge
about inner products, which automatically leads us to the modified metric tensor.
Let us end with a small related remark. We have seen in Chapter(
5) that the
metric can also be used to describe curved spaces. The Minkowski metric which we
have encountered in the present section can be used to describe curvedspace-time.
This concept is at the basis of the general theory of relativity. In that theory, gravity
is explained as a consequence of the curvature of space-time. A good introduction
to this theory is given in [
5].

B
Geometrical representation
The tensors as we have seen them in the main text may appear rather abstract. How-
ever, it is possible to visualise their meaning quite explicitly, in terms of geometrical
objects. A simple example of this is the arrow-vector. An arrow-vector is effectively
just a set of numbers that transforms in a particular way under a basis transforma-
tion. However, it is useful to think about it in terms of an arrow, so as to visualise
its meaning.
We can make a similar geometrical visualisation of a covector, as well as for all
other tensors. The present appendix contains a list of thesegeometrical representa-
tions. As we go along we will also describe how various manipulations with tensors
(such as additions and inner products) can be translated to this geometrical picture.
None of this is necessary in order to be able to compute with tensors, but it may
help in understanding such computations.
•arrow-vector
An arrow-vector is represented by (how else) an arrow in ann-dimensional
space. The components of the vector (i.e. the numbersv
m
) are obtained by
determining the projections of the arrow onto the axes. See figure
B.1.
Figure B.1:Geometrical representation of a vector, and the determination of its com-
ponents by projection onto the axes.
•co-vector
A co-vectors is closely related to the gradient of a functionf(~x), so it makes
sense to look for a geometrical representation which is somehow connected
to gradients. A useful related concept is that of contour lines (curves of equal
height, in two dimensions) or contour surfaces (in three dimensions). Now
consider two consecutive contour lines. The intersection they make with a
neighbouringx
2
=constant lijne is equal to the increase ofx
1
necessary to
41

APPENDIX B. GEOMETRICAL REPRESENTATION
increasef(~x)by 1, if the other coordinate is kept constant. So in two dimen-
sions,

(2.1)
Therefore, if we take the inverse of this intersection, we again obtain the first
component of the gradient.
Given the above, it makes sense to use, for the generic representation of a
co-vector, two consecutive lines (or, in three dimensions,planes), such that
the intersections with the axes are equal to the components of the co-vector.
Note that one should also keep track of the order of the lines or planes. In the
representation sketched in figure
B.2we have drawn a flexible type of arrow.
This is not an arrow-vector as above, but only meant to indicate the order of
the surfaces. We could equally well have labelled the surfaces with different
numbers or colours.

components by computing the inverse of the intersection with the axes.

An anti-symmetric contravariant second order tensor can bemade from two
vectors according to
t
mν
=v
m
w
ν
−w
m
v
ν
.(2.2)
This is a bit like an outer product. The order of the two vectors is clearly
of relevance. We can visualise this object as a surface with agiven area and
orientation. The components of the tensor can be obtained bymeasuring the
projection of the surface onto the various coordinate surfaces. A negative com-
ponent is obtained when the orientation of the surface assocatiated to the ten-
sor is negative. Let us illustrate this with an example: if the surface of the
projection on thex
1
,x
2
surface is equal to 2, then thet
12
component equals 2
and thet
21
component equals−2. See figures

We can visualise this object as a kind of tube with an orientation. The compo-
nents can be found by computing the intersections of this tube with all coor-
dinate surfaces, and inverting these numbers. Again one hasto keep track of
the orientation of the intersections. See figure
B.5.

•addition of vectors
Addition of vectors is of course a well-known procedure. Simply translate one
arrow along the other one until the top. This translated arrow now points to
the sum-arrow. See figure
B.6.
Figure B.6:Geometrical representation of the addition of vectors.
•addition of co-vectors
The addition of covectors is somewhat more complicated. Instead of trying to
describe this in words, it is easier to simply give the visualrepresentation of
this addition. See figure for a two-dimensional representation.
•inner product between a vector and a co-vector
The inner product of a vector and a co-vector is the ratio of the length of the in-
tersection which the co-vector has with the vector and the length of the vector.
See figure
B.8for a three-dimensional representation.

•second order symmetric co-variant tensorg
mν
The metric tensor belongs to this class. It therefore makes sense to look for
a representation which is related to the inner product. A suitable one is to
consider the set of all points which have a unit distance to a given point~x
0
,
{~x∈R

If the metric is position-dependent,g=g(~x), then the point~x

is equal to the
point at which the corresponding metricg
mν
is evaluated.
Now it is also clear what is the connection to the ellipses of chapter
5. See
figure
B.9for a three-dimensional representation: an ellipsoid.
Figure B.9:Geometrical representation of a second order symmetric covariant ten-
sor.
It is considerably more complicated to make a geometrical representation of a
second order symmetric contravariant tensor, so we will omit that case.
•turning an arrow-vector into a co-vector
The procedure of converting a vector to a co-vector can also be illustrated ge-
ometrically, see figure
B.10for a two-dimensional representation. The two
44

long slanted lines are tangent to the circle, and the bottom horizontal line
goes through the center of the circle. This representation fails when the arrow-
vector is shorter than the radius of the circle.

.
Compute the inverse of this matrix (either by replacingφby−φor by matrix
inversion). Show that(Λ

is equal toΛ.
2. In Cartesian coordinate systems the basis vectors are orthogonal to each other,
~e
1
~e
2
=0 .
(This is a somewhat misleading notation. You might be tempted to interpret
this as the inner product of two basis vectors, in which the components of the
basis vectors are expressed in the basis itself. That would of coursealways
yield a trivial zero).
If we transform from one such Cartesian coordinate system toanother one,
~e
1
′
=Λ~e
1
&~e
2
′
=Λ~e
2
,
(whereΛis the transformation matrix) then this relation should of course con-
tinue to hold,
~e

Insert the transformation rule given above and show that, for transforma-
tions between two Cartesian systems, the tranformation matrixΛis equal

.
2. A matrix can be viewed as an object which transforms one vector into another
one. We have seen that this can be a normal transformation or abasis transfor-
mation. The question is now: does a normal transformation matrix transform
too upon a change of basis. And how? Write this out in normal matrix no-
tation, withSthe matrix which transforms from the original system to the
primed system, andAthe matrix which is to be transformed.
Hint:
~y=A~x,
and after a basis (or coordinate) transformation
A~y=S(A~x),
but there is also a matrixA
′
which satisfies
S~y=A
′
(S~x).

new object is again a tensor.
C.4. Tensoren, algemeen

erties of tensors.
3. Show, by writing out the transformation of a(1, 1)-tensor, op te schrijven, dat
het geen zin heeft om te spreken van symmetrie of anti-symmetrie van een
tensor in indices die niet van hetzelfde soort zijn. (Laat dus zien dat die eigen-

6. Hoe transformeert een kronecker-delta? De kronecker-delta is symmetrisch;
waarom blijft de eigenschap van symmetrie hier wel behouden, terwijl toch is
bewezen dat de symmetrie in een boven en onderindex niet behouden blijft?
7. We hebben in opgave

Laat aan de hand daarvan zien hoe de matrixA

hand van de twee gevonden vergelijkingen aan dat het objectguit de tekst
