Preface to the Fourth Edition
An introductory material and energy balance course traditionally
plays several important roles in the chemical engineering curricu-
lum. On the most obvious level, it prepares the student to formu-
late and solve material and energy balances on chemical process
systems and lays the foundation for subsequent courses in ther-
modynamics, transport phenomena, separation processes, kinetics
and  reactor  design,  and  process  dynamics  and  control.  More
fundamentally, it introduces the engineering approach to solving
process-related problems: breaking a process into its components,
establishing the relations between known and unknown process
variables,  assembling  the  information  needed  to  solve  for  the
unknowns using a combination of experimentation, empiricism,
and the application of natural laws, and,finally, putting the pieces
together to obtain the desired problem solution.
We have tried in this book to fulfill each of these functions.
Moreover, recognizing that the material and energy balance course
is often the students’first real encounter with what they think may
be their chosen profession, we have attempted to provide in the
text  a  realistic,  informative,  and  positive  introduction  to  the
practice of chemical engineering. In thefirst chapter we survey
fields that recent chemical engineering graduates have entered and
describe the variety of research, design, and production problems
they  might  confront.  In  the  rest  of  the  book  we  systematically
develop the structure of elementary process analysis: definitions,
measurement  and  calculation  of  process  variables,  conservation
laws and thermodynamic relations that govern the performance of
processes, and physical properties of process materials that must
be determined in order to design a new process or analyze and
improve an existing one.
The  chemical  process  constitutes  the  framework  for  the
presentation of all of the text material. When we bring in concepts
from  physical  chemistry  such  as  vapor  pressure,  solubility,  and
heat capacity, we introduce them as quantities whose values are
required to determine process variables or to perform material and
energy  balance  calculations  on  a  process.  When  we  discuss
spreadsheets and computational techniques, we present them on
the same need-to-know basis in the context of process analysis.
Not much has happened to the laws of conservation of mass
and energy or the basic principles of physical chemistry since the
most recent edition ofElementary Principlesappeared a decade
ago, so instructors who used the third edition of the book will see
some changes in the chapter texts, but they won’t be dramatic. The
biggest difference is in the problems, which reflect the broadening
of the scope of chemical engineering during the lifetime of this
book from almost exclusively industrial chemistry and petrochem-
icals  to  biomedical,  biochemical,  biomolecular,  environmental,
energy, materials, and safety applications. There are around 350
new  and  revised  chapter-end  problems  in  this  edition,  many  of
which  address  those  diverse  areas.  In  addition,  an  entirely  new
suite of resources for students and instructors has been assembled,
including  a  spreadsheet-based  tool  that  eliminates  much  of  the
drudgery of routine calculations that require large expenditures of
time and have little instructional value.
The two authors of thefirst three editions acknowledge with
gratitude  the  contributions  of  colleagues  and  students  from  the
time work began on the book. Our thanks go to Dick Seagrave and
the late Professors John Stevens and David Marsland, who read the
first draft of thefirst edition and offered many suggestions for its
improvement; our department head, the late Jim Ferrell, who gave
us invaluable encouragement when we brashly (some might say,
foolishly)  launched  into  the  book  in  our  third  year  as  faculty
members;  and  our  colleagues  around  the  world  who  helped  us
prepare problems and case studies and suggested improvements to
each successive edition. We raise our glasses to the students in the
Fall 1973 offering of CHE 205 at N.C. State, who had the bad luck
to get thefirst draft as a course text. We also thank the N.C. State
graduate  and  undergraduate  students  who  helped  prepare  the
solution  manuals,  and  the  many  N.C.  State  and  Georgia  Tech
students who took the trouble to point out errors in the text. We
know they did it out of a sense of professional responsibility and
not just to collect the dollars.
The three authors of this edition thank our colleagues who
contributed ideas for end-of-chapter problems in areas of exper-
tise far removed from ours, whose names are acknowledged in
footnotes.  We  are  particularly  grateful  to  Stephanie  Farrell,
Mariano  Savelski,  and  Stewart  Slater  of  Rowan  University
for  contributing  several  excellent  problems  from  a  library  of
pharmaceutical engineering problems (see<
www.PharmaHUB
.org
>). Support for the development of the library was provided
by a grant from  the National Science Foundation through the
Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate
Systems, ECC0540855.
Support  for  the  development  of  the  problems  on  climbing
Kilimanjaro  was  provided  by  grants  from  the  National  Science
Foundation  through  the  Division  of  Undergraduate  Education
grants # 0088437 and 1140631. These problems were contributed
by Stephanie Farrell of Rowan University.
Our  heartfelt  thanks  also  go  to  Emma  Barber,  Michael
Burroughs,  Andrew  Drake,  David  Hurrelbrink,  Samuel  Jasper,
Michael Jones, William Kappler, Katie Kirkley, Manami Kudoh,
George Marshall, Jonathan Mihu, Adam Mullis, Kaitlyn Nilsen,
Cailean  Pritchard,  Jordan  Shack,  Gitanjali  Talreja,  and  Kristen
iv

Twidt,  who  contributed  to  the  development  and  testing  of  the
fourth edition on-line content and solution manual, and especially
to  Karen  Uffalussy,  who  meticulously  read  every  sentence  and
equation  in  the  manuscript  and  caught  a  frightening  number  of
mistakes, some of which dated back to thefirst edition.
Finally, we thank our Wiley colleagues Dan Sayre and Jenny
Welter for their help in bringing this and previous editions into
existence;  Rebecca,  Sandra,  and  Michael  for  many  years  of
unfailing  encouragement  and  support;  and  the  late  Magnificent
Mary  Wade,  who  uncomplainingly  and  with  great  good  humor
typed revision after revision of thefirst edition, until the authors,
unable to stand any more, declared the book done.

Notes to Instructors
Topical coverage
The organization of this text has been planned to provide enough
flexibility  to  accommodate  classes  with  diverse  backgrounds
within  the  scope  of  a  one-semester  or  two-quarter  course.  We
anticipate that semester-long courses in which most students have
traditionalfirst-year engineering backgrounds will cover most of
thefirst  nine  chapters,  and  a  one-quarter  course  should  cover
Chapters  1  through  6.  Students  who  have  been  exposed  to
dimensional  analysis  and  elementary  data  correlation  can  skip
or  skim  Chapter  2,  and  students  whose  freshman  chemistry
courses provided a detailed coverage of process variable defini-
tions  and  the  systematic  use  of  units  to  describe  and  analyze
chemical  processes  may  omit  Chapter  3.  The  time  gained  as  a
result of these omissions may be used to cover additional sections
in Chapters 4 through 9 or to add Chapter 10 on transient balances.
Teaching and promoting a systematic
approach to process analysis
We have consistently found that the key to student success in this
course  is  approaching  problems  systematically:  drawing  and
labelingflow charts, counting degrees of freedom to make sure
that problems are solvable, and formulating solution plans before
doing  any  calculations.  We  have  also  found  that  students  are
remarkably resistant to this process, preferring to launch directly
into writing equations in the hope that sooner or later a solution
will emerge. The students who make the transition to the system-
atic approach generally do well, while those who continue to resist
it frequently fail.
In  our  experience,  the  only  way  students  learn  to  use  this
approach is by repeatedly practicing it. Hundreds of chapter-end
problems in the text are structured to provide this practice. Represent-
ative assignment schedules are given in the instructor’s resources,
and there is enough duplication of problem types for the schedules
to be varied considerably from one course offering to another.
Support for a wide range of course
learning outcomes
Most of the problems in the book focus on setting up and solving
basic material and energy balance problems, which is as it should
be. Not all of them, however: many exercises focus on learning
objectives  beyond  analytical  problem-solving  skills,  including
developing critical and creative thinking skills and understanding
the industrial and social contexts of many of the processes treated
in the chapter-end problems. (All of those learning outcomes, we
might  add,  map  onto  required  learning  outcomes  of  the  ABET
Engineering  Criteria.)  Some  of  the  exercises  are  included  in
the problems, and others are separate“creativity exercises”and
“explore and discover exercises.”
We encourage instructors to use these exercises as focal
points for in-class activities, include them in homework assign-
ments, and put similar exercises on tests after ample practice
has been provided in assignments. The exercises can convey to
the  students  a  sense  of  the  challenging  and  intellectually
stimulating  possibilities  in  a  chemical  engineering  career,
which  may  be  the  most  important  task  that  the  introductory
course can accomplish.

Notes with Gapsis an extensively class-tested set of lecture notes
for Chapters 2–9 of the text. There are two versions of the set. One is for
students and includes blank spaces (gaps) in which tofill in answers to
imbedded  questions,  curves  on  plots  for  which  only  the  axes  are
shown, stream labels onflowcharts, numbers in degrees-of-freedom
analyses, and critical steps in derivations and problem solutions. On the
second set of notes, which is for instructors, the gaps arefilled in.
The  student  version  of  the  notes  can  be  loaded  on  a  tablet
computer  and  projected  in  class,  or  it  can  be  printed,  duplicated,
and bound into a coursepack that students bring to every class session.
The  instructor  can  direct  the  students  to  read  through  completely
straightforward parts of the notes (short simple paragraphs, definitions
of  terms  and  system  variables,  and  routine  algebraic  calculations),
which students can do in much lesstime than it would take to present
the same information in a traditional lecture. When instructors reach
gaps, they may either lecture on them traditionally or (better) direct the
students tofill in the gaps in active learning exercises. The students
don’t  have  to  spend  a  lot  of  time  taking  notes  on  straightforward
content but can focus almost entirely on the key methods and concepts
in the lecture, and they get practice and immediate feedback on hard or
tricky  parts of the  methods.  Research has shown that handing out
partial notes of this type leads to deeper learning than either requiring
students to take all their own notes or giving them complete sets of
notes either before or after class.

Postscript:
Introduction to an Author
Many instructors and students who have used this book can’t tell you its title without looking at the
cover. Since thefirst edition appeared in 1978, the text has generally been referred to as“Felder
and Rousseau.”The practice of using authors’last names to refer to textbooks is common, and it
has become so universal for this one that one of us has occasionally begun talks by informing the
audience that hisfirst name is Ronald, not Felderand. So whether or not you know the title, if
you’ve used the book before you probably noticed that the list of authors has metamorphosed in
this edition to FelderandRousseauandBullard.
Who is Bullard, you might be asking. Before we formally introduce Lisa, let us give you a
little history. We began work on this book when we were young untenured assistant professors.
That was in 1972. By the time we started work on the fourth edition, we were neither untenured
nor assistant professors, and you can do the math on“young”for yourself. We agreed that our
careers and interests had moved in different directions, and if there were to be more editions after
this one, someone else would have to play a major role in writing them. It made sense to bring in
that individual to work with us and help assure a smooth transition in the future.
We quickly assembled  a shopping list  of desirable  attributes  for  our future  coauthor. We
wanted  tofind an outstanding teacher with an extensive  background in teaching material  and
energy balances; an experienced engineer withfirst-hand knowledge of both the science and the
art of the practice of chemical engineering; and a good writer, who could carry on the work long
after the original authors had begun to fully devote themselves to their children, grandchildren,
good books, plays, operas, excellent food and wine, and occasional stays infive-star inns in the
beautiful places in the world. (Look, you have your fantasies, we have ours.)
We found some excellent candidates, and then we got to Lisa Bullard and our search was
over. Lisa was all of those things, as well as thefinest academic advisor her N.C. State coauthor
had ever seen or heard of and an author of papers and presenter of national and international
seminars and workshops on effective teaching and advising. And so we invited her to join us, and
she accepted. Our good fortune. And yours.

Glossary of Chemical Process Terms
Glossary terms indicated with
@
can be found in the Equipment Encyclopedia atwww.wiley.com/college/felder.
@
AbsorptionA process in which a gas mixture contacts a liquid solvent and a component (or several components)
of the gas dissolves in the liquid. In anabsorption columnorabsorption tower(or simplyabsorber), the solvent
enters the top of a column,flows down, and emerges at the bottom, and the gas enters at the bottom,flows up
(contacting the liquid), and leaves at the top.
AdiabaticA term applied to a process in which no heat is transferred between the process system and its
surroundings.
@
AdsorptionA process in which a gas or liquid mixture contacts a solid (theadsorbent) and a mixture component
(theadsorbate) adheres to the surface of the solid.
BarometerA device that measures atmospheric pressure.
@
BoilerA process unit in which tubes pass through a combustion furnace.Boiler feedwateris fed into the tubes,
and heat transferred from the hot combustion products through the tube walls converts the feedwater to steam.
Boiling point(at a given pressure)For  a  pure  species,  the  temperature  at which  the  liquid  and  vapor  can
coexist in equilibrium at the given pressure. When applied to the heating of a mixture of liquidsexposed
to a gas at the given pressure, the temperature at which the mixture begins to boil.
Bottoms productThe product that leaves the bottom of a distillation column. The bottoms product is relatively
rich in the less volatile components of the feed to the column.
Bubble point(of a mixture of liquids at a given pressure)The temperature at which thefirst vapor bubble
appears when the mixture is heated.
Calibration(of a process variable measurement instrument)A procedure in which an instrument is used to
measure several independently known process variable values, and acalibration curveof known variable values
versus the corresponding instrument readings is plotted. Once the instrument has been calibrated, readings
obtained with it can be converted to equivalent process variable values directly from the calibration curve.
@
CatalystA substance that significantly increases the rate of a chemical reaction although it is neither a reactant
nor a product.
Compressibility factor,zzPV/nRTfor a gas. Ifz1, thenPVnRT(the ideal-gas equation of state) and
the gas is said to behave ideally.
@
CompressorA device that raises the pressure of a gas.
CondensationA process in which an entering gas is cooled and/or compressed, causing one or more of the gas
components to liquefy. Uncondensed gases and liquidcondensateleave the condenser as separate streams.
Critical pressure,P
c
The highest pressure at which distinct vapor and liquid phases can coexist for a species.
Critical temperature,T
c
The highest temperature at which distinct vapor and liquid phases can coexist for a
species. The critical temperature and pressure, collectively referred to as thecritical constants, are listed for
various species in Table B.1.
@
CrystallizationA process in which a liquid is cooled or solvent is evaporated to an extent that solid crystals
form. The crystals in aslurry(suspension of solids in a liquid) leaving the crystallizer may subsequently be
separated from the liquid in afilter or centrifuge.
DecanterA device in which two liquid phases or liquid and solid phases separate by gravity.
Degrees of freedomWhen applied to a general process, the difference between the number of unknown process
variables and the number of equations relating those variables; the number of unknown variables for which values
x

must be specified before the remaining values can be calculated. When applied to a system at equilibrium, the
number of intensive system variables for which values must be specified before the remaining values can be
calculated. The degrees of freedom in the second sense is determined using the Gibbs Phase Rule.
Dew point(of a gas mixture at a given pressure)The temperature at which thefirst liquid droplet appears when
the mixture is cooled at constant pressure.
@
DistillationA process in which a mixture of two or more species is fed to a vertical column that contains either a
series of vertically spaced horizontal plates or solid packing through whichfluid canflow. Liquid mixtures of the
feed componentsflow down the column and vapor mixturesflow up. Interphase contact, partial condensation of
the vapor, and partial vaporization of the liquid all take place throughout the column. The vaporflowing up the
column becomes progressively richer in the more volatile components of the feed, and the liquidflowing down
becomes richer in the less volatile components. The vapor leaving the top of the column is condensed: part of the
condensate is taken off as theoverhead productand the rest is recycled to the reactor asreflux, becoming the
liquid stream thatflows down the column. The liquid leaving the bottom of the column is partially vaporized: the
vapor is recycled to the reactor asboilup, becoming the vapor stream thatflows up the column, and the residual
liquid is taken off as thebottoms product.
@
DryingA process in which a wet solid is heated or contacted with a hot gas stream, causing some or all of the
entering liquid to evaporate. The vapor and the gas it evaporates into emerge as one outlet stream, and the solid
and remaining residual liquid emerge as a second outlet stream.
Enthalpy (kJ)Property of a system defined asHUPV, whereUinternal energy,Pabsolute pressure,
andVvolume of  the system.
@
Evaporation(vaporization)A process in which a pure liquid, liquid mixture, or solvent in a solution is
vaporized.
@
Extraction(liquid extraction)A process in which a liquid mixture of two species (thesoluteand thefeed carrier)
is contacted in a mixer with another liquid (thesolvent) that is immiscible or nearly immiscible with the feed
carrier. When the liquids are contacted, solute transfers from the feed carrier to the solvent. The combined
mixture is then allowed to settle into two phases that are then separated by gravity.
@
FiltrationA process in which a slurry of solid particles (often crystals) suspended in a liquid, most of which
passes through thefilter to form thefiltrate; the solids and some entrained liquid are retained on thefilter to form
thefilter cake. Filtration may also be used to separate solids or liquids from gases.
@
Flash vaporizationA process in which a liquid feed at a high pressure is suddenly exposed to a lower pressure,
causing some vaporization to occur. The vapor product is rich in the more volatile components of the feed and the
residual liquid is rich in the less volatile components.
Flue gasSee stack gas.
HeatEnergy transferred between a system and its surroundings as a consequence of a temperature difference.
Heat alwaysflows from a higher temperature to a lower one. It is conventionally defined as positive when itflows
to a system from its surroundings.
@
Heat exchangerA process unit through which twofluid streams at different temperaturesflow on opposite sides
of a metal barrier (e.g., a bundle of metal tubes). Heat is transferred from the stream at the higher temperature
through the barrier to the other stream.
Internal energy (U)The total energy possessed by the individual molecules in a system (as opposed to the
kinetic and potential energies of the system as a whole).Uis a strong function of temperature, phase, and
molecular structure and a weak function of pressure (it is independent of pressure for ideal gases). Its absolute
value cannot be determined, so it is always expressed relative to a reference state at which it is defined to be zero.
@
MembraneA thin solid or liquidfilm through which one or more species in a process stream can permeate.
@
Overhead productThe product that leaves the top of a distillation column. The overhead product is relatively
rich in the most volatile components of the feed to the column.
Glossary of Chemical Process Termsxi

@
PumpA device used to propel a liquid or slurry from one location to another, usually through a pipe or tube.
@
ScrubberAn absorption column designed to remove an undesirable component from a gas stream.
SettlerSee decanter.
Shaft workAll work transferred between a continuous system and its surroundings other than that done by or on
the processfluid at the system entrance and exit.
Stack gasThe gaseous products exiting from a combustion furnace.
@
StrippingA process in which a liquid containing a dissolved gasflows down a column and a gas (stripping gas)
flows up the column at conditions such that the dissolved gas comes out of solution and is carried off with the
stripping gas.
Vapor pressureThe pressure at which pure liquid A can coexist with its vapor at a given temperature. In this
text, vapor pressures can be determined from tabulated data (e.g., Tables B.3 and B5–B7 for water) or the Antoine
equation (Table B.4).
Volume percent(% v/v)For liquid mixtures, the percentage of the total volume occupied by a particular
component; for ideal gases, the same as mole percent. For nonideal gases the volume percent has no meaningful
physical significance.
WorkEnergy transferred between a system and its surroundings as a consequence of motion against a restraining
force, electricity or radiation, or any other driving force except a temperature difference. In this book, work is
defined as positive if itflows to a system from its surroundings.

CHAPTER

What Some Chemical
Engineers Do for a Living
Last May, thousands of chemical engineering seniors took their lastfinal examination, attended
their graduation ceremonies,flipped their tassels and threw their mortarboards in the air, enjoyed
their farewell parties, said goodbye to one another and promised faithfully to stay in touch, and
headed off in an impressive variety of geographical and career directions.
Since you bought this book, you are probably thinking about following in the footsteps of
those graduates—spending the next few years learning to be a chemical engineer and possibly the
next 40 applying what you learn in a career. Even so, it is a fairly safe bet that, like most people in
your position, you have only a limited idea of what chemical engineering is or what chemical
engineers do. A logical way for us to begin this book might therefore be with a definition of
chemical engineering.
Unfortunately, no universally accepted definition of chemical engineering exists, and almost
every type of skilled work you can think of is done somewhere by people educated as chemical
engineers. Providing a definition has recently become even more difficult as university chemical
engineering departments have morphed into departments of chemical and biomolecular engineer-
ing or chemical and materials engineering or chemical and environmental engineering. We will
therefore abandon the idea of formulating a simple definition, and instead take a closer look at
what those recent graduates did either immediately after graduation or following a well-earned
vacation.  We  will  also  do  some  speculating  about  what  they  might  do  several  years  after
graduating,  based  on  our  experiences  with  graduates  from  previous  classes.  Consider  these
examples and see if any of them sound like the sort of career you can see yourself pursuing and
enjoying.
About 45% of the class went to work for chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, and polymer
(plastics) manufacturingfirms.
Another 35% went to work for government agencies and design and consultingfirms (many
specializing in environmental regulation and pollution control), companies infields such as
microelectronics and information technology that have not been traditionally associated with
chemical  engineering,  andfirms  specializing  in  emerging  areas  such  as  biotechnology  and
sustainable  development  (development  that  addresses  economic,  ecological,  cultural,  and
political considerations).
About 10% of the class went directly into graduate school in chemical engineering. The master’s
degree candidates will get advanced training in traditional chemical engineering areas (thermo-
dynamics, chemical reactor analysis and design,fluid dynamics, mass and heat transfer, and
chemical process design and control) and emerging areas such as biotechnology, biomedicine,
materials science and engineering, nanotechnology, and sustainable development. They will have
access to most of the jobs available to the bachelor’s degree holders plus jobs in those emerging
areas that require additional training. The doctoral degree candidates will get more advanced
training and work on major research projects, and in four tofive years most will graduate and
either go into industrial research and development or join university faculties.
A small number were drawn to entrepreneurship, and within a few years after graduation will
start their own companies in areas that might or might not have anything to do with their college
backgrounds.
3

The remaining 10% of the class went into graduate school in areas other than engineering,
discovering that their chemical engineering backgrounds made them strongly competitive for
admission  to  top  universities.  Several  who  took  biology  electives  in  their  undergraduate
programs went to medical school. Others went to law school, planning to go into patent or
corporate law, and still others enrolled in Master of Business Administration programs with the
goal of moving into management in industry.
One  graduate  joined  the  Peace  Corps  for  a  two-year  stint  in  East  Africa  helping  local
communities develop sanitary waste disposal systems and also teaching science and English
in  a  rural  school.  When  she  returns,  she  will  complete  a  Ph.D.  program  in  environmental
engineering,  join  a  chemical  engineering  faculty,  write  a  definitive  book  on  environmental
applications of chemical engineering principles, quickly rise through the ranks to become a full
professor, resign after 10 years to run for the United States Senate, win two terms, and eventually
become  head  of  a  large  and  highly  successful  private  foundation  dedicated  to  improving
education in economically deprived communities. She will attribute her career successes in part
to the problem-solving skills she acquired in her undergraduate training in chemical engineering.
At various points in their careers, some of the graduates will work in chemical or biochemical
or  biomedical  or  material  science  laboratories  doing  research  and  development  or  quality
engineering, at computer terminals designing processes and products and control systems, at
field locations managing the construction and startup of manufacturing plants, on production
floors supervising and troubleshooting and improving operations, on the road doing technical
sales  and  service,  in  executive  offices  performing  administrative  functions,  in  government
agencies responsible for environmental and occupational health and safety, in hospitals and
clinics practicing medicine or biomedical engineering, in law offices specializing in chemical
process-related patent work, and in classrooms teaching the next generation of students.
The careers just described are clearly too diverse to fall into a single category. They involve
disciplines including physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, medicine, law, applied
mathematics, statistics, information technology, economics, research, design, construction, sales
and service, production supervision, and business administration. The single feature they have in
common is that chemical engineers can be found doing them. Some of the specific knowledge
needed to carry out the tasks will be presented later in the chemical engineering curriculum, and
most of it must be learned after graduation. There are, however, basic techniques that have been
developed  for  setting  up  and  attacking  technical  problems  that  apply  across  a  broad  range  of
disciplines. What some of these techniques are and how and when to use them are the subjects of
this book.
4CHAPTER 1What Some Chemical Engineers Do for a Living

CHAPTER
2
Introduction to Engineering
Calculations
Chapter 1 suggests the range of problems encompassed by chemical engineering,
1
both in traditional
areas  of  chemical  processing  and  in  relatively  newfields  such  as  environmental  science  and
engineering,  bioengineering,  and  semiconductor  manufacturing.  Differences  between  the  areas
mentioned in the chapter—chemical manufacturing, genetic engineering, and pollution control—are
obvious. In this book, we examine the similarities.
One similarity is that all of the systems described involveprocessesdesigned to transform
raw materials into desired products. Many of the problems that arise in connection with the design
of  a  new  process  or  the  analysis  of  an  existing  one  are  of  a  certain type:  given  amounts  and
properties of the raw materials, calculate amounts and properties of the products, or vice versa.
The object of this text is to present a systematic approach to the solution of problems of this
type. This chapter presents basic techniques for expressing the values of system variables and for
setting up and solving equations that relate these variables. In Chapter 3 we discuss the variables of
specific  concern  in  process  analysis—temperatures,  pressures,  chemical  compositions,  and
amounts  orflow  rates  of  process  streams—describing  how  they  are  defined,  calculated,  and,
in some cases, measured. Parts Two and Three of the book deal with the laws of conservation of
mass and energy, which relate the inputs and outputs of manufacturing systems, power plants, and
the human body. The laws of nature constitute the underlying structure of all process design and

After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
Convert a quantity expressed in one set of units into its equivalent in any other dimensionally
consistent units using appropriate conversion factors. [For example, convert a heatflux of
235 kJ/(m
2
s) into its equivalent in Btu/(ft
2
h).]
Identify  the  units  commonly  used  to  express  both  mass  and  weight  in  SI,  CGS,  and  U.S.
customary units. Calculate weights from given masses in either natural units (e.g., kgm/s
2
or
lb
m
ft/s
2
)ordefined units (N, lb
f
).
Identify  the  number  of  significantfigures  in  a  given  value  expressed  in  either  decimal  or
scientific notation and state the precision with which the value is known based on its significant
figures. Determine the correct number of significantfigures in the result of a series of arithmetic
operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing).
Validate  a quantitative problem solution by applying back-substitution, order-of-magnitude
estimation, and the test of reasonableness.
Given a set of measured values, calculate the sample mean, range, sample variance, and sample
standard deviation. Explain in your own words what each of the calculated quantities means
and why it is important.

When we refer to chemical engineering, we intend to encompass all aspects of a discipline that includes applications in
biology as well as a number of otherfields.

Explain the concept of dimensional homogeneity of equations. Given the units of some terms in
an equation, use this concept to assign units to other terms.
Given tabulated data for two variables (xandy), use linear interpolation between two data points to
estimate the value of one variable for a given value of the other. Sketch a plot ofyversusxand use it
to illustrate how and when linear interpolation can lead to significant errors in estimated values.
Given two points on a straight-line plot ofyversusx, derive the expression foryx. Given
tabulated data forxandy,fit a straight line by visual inspection.
Given  a  two-parameter  expression  relating  two  variables  [such  asyasin2xborP

straight line. Given data forxandy, generate the plot and estimate the parametersaandb.
Given  a  power-law  or  exponential  expression  involving  two  variables  (such  asyax
b
or
kae

), state what you would plot on rectangular, semilog, or logarithmic axes that would
generate a straight line. Given a linear plot involving two variables on any of the three types of
axes and two points on the line, determine the expression relating the two variables and the
values of the two parameters.
2.1UNITS AND DIMENSIONS
A measured or counted quantity has a numericalvalue(2.47) and aunit(whatever there are 2.47
of). It is useful in most engineering calculations—and essential in many—to write both the value
and the unit of each quantity appearing in an equation:
2 meters;
1
3
second;4:29 kilograms;5 gold rings
Adimensionis a property that can be measured, such as length, time, mass, or temperature, or
calculated by multiplying or dividing other dimensions, such as length/time (velocity), length
3
(volume), or mass/length
3
(density). Measurable units (as opposed to countable units) are specific
values of dimensions that have been defined by convention, custom, or law, such as grams for
mass, seconds for time, and centimeters or feet for length.
Units can be treated like algebraic variables when quantities are added, subtracted, multiplied,
or divided.Two quantities may be added or subtracted only if their units are the same.

2.2CONVERSION OF UNITS
A measured quantity can be expressed in terms of any units having the appropriate dimension. A
particular velocity, for instance, may be expressed in ft/s, miles/h, cm/yr, or any other ratio of a length
unit to a time unit. The numerical value of the velocity naturally depends on the units chosen.
The equivalence between two expressions of the same quantity may be defined in terms of a
ratio:
1cm
10 mm
1 centimeter per 10 millimeters(2.2-1)
10 mm
1cm
10 millimeters per centimeter(2.2-2)
10 mm
1cm

2

100 mm
2
1cm
2
(2.2-3)
Ratios of the form of Equations 2.2-1, 2.2-2, and 2.2-3 are known asconversion factors.
To convert a quantity expressed in terms of one unit to its equivalent in terms of another unit,
multiply the given quantity by the conversion factor(new unit/old unit). For example, to convert
36 mg to its equivalent in grams, write
36 mg
1g
1000 mg
0:036 g(2.2-4)
(Note how the old units cancel, leaving the desired unit.) An alternative way to write this equation
is to use a vertical line instead of the multiplication symbol:
36 mg
1g
1000 mg
0:036 g
Carrying along units in calculations of this type is the best way of avoiding the common
mistake of multiplying when you mean to divide and vice versa. In the given example, the result is
known to be correct because milligrams cancel leaving only grams on the left side, whereas
36 mg
1000 mg
1g
36,000 mg
2
/g
is clearly wrong. (More precisely, it is not what you intended to calculate.)
The practice of carrying units along with calculations will require discipline, but it is sure to save
you from making countless errors. To illustrate, simply insert the phrase“unit conversion errors”in
your favorite search engine, and a list of famous ones will be displayed. Our experience is that once
you start carrying units, two things will happen: (1) you will make fewer mistakes in calculations,
and (2) you often will gain understanding of otherwise incomprehensible mathematical expressions.
If you are given a quantity having a compound unit [e.g., miles/h, cal/(g°C)], and you wish to
convert it to its equivalent in terms of another set of units, set up adimensional equation: write the
given quantity and its units on the left, write the units of conversion factors that cancel the old units
and replace them with the desired ones,fill in the values of the conversion factors, and carry out the
indicated arithmetic tofind the desired value. (See Example 2.2-1.)

2.3SYSTEMS OF UNITS
A system of units has the following components:
1.Base unitsfor mass, length, time, temperature, electrical current, and light intensity.
2.Multiple units,which are defined as multiples or fractions of base units such as minutes, hours,
and milliseconds, all of which are defined in terms of the base unit of a second. Multiple units
are defined for convenience rather than necessity; it is simply more convenient to refer to 3 yr
than to 94,608,000 s.
3.Derived units,obtained in one of two ways:
(a)By multiplying and dividing base or multiple units (cm
2
, ft/min, kgm/s
2
, etc.). Derived
units of this type are referred to ascompound units.
(b)As defined equivalents of compound units (e.g., 1 erg1gcm/s
2
,1lb
f
32:174 lb
m
ft/s
2
).
The“Système Internationale d’Unités,”orSIfor short, has gained widespread acceptance in
the scientific and engineering community.
2
Two of the base SI units—the ampere for electrical
current and the candela for luminous intensity—will not concern us in this book. A third, the
kelvin  for  temperature,  will  be  discussed  later.  The  others  are  the  meter  (m)  for  length,  the
kilogram (kg) for mass, and the second (s) for time.
Prefixes are used in SI to indicate powers of ten. The most common of these prefixes and their
abbreviations are mega (M) for 10
6
(1 megawatt1MW10
6
watts), kilo (k) for 10
3
, centi (c)
for 10
2
, milli (m) for 10
3
, micro (μ) for 10
6
, and nano (n) for 10
9
. The conversion factors
between, say, centimeters and meters are therefore 10
2
m/cm and 10
2
cm/m. The principal SI
units and prefixes are summarized in Table 2.3-1.
TheCGS systemis almost identical to SI, the principal difference being that grams (g) and
centimeters (cm) are used instead of kilograms and meters as the base units of mass and length.
The principal units of the CGS system are shown in Table 2.3-1.
The base units of theU.S. customary systemare the foot (ft) for length, the pound-mass
(lb
m
) for mass, and the second (s) for time. This system has two principal difficulties. Thefirst is
the  occurrence  of  conversion  factors  (such  as  1 ft/12 in),  which,  unlike  those  in  the  metric
systems, are not multiples of 10; the second, which has to do with the unit of force, is discussed
in the next section.

2.4FORCE AND WEIGHT
According to Newton’s second law of motion, force is proportional to the product of mass and
acceleration (length/time

).Natural force unitsare, therefore, kgm/s
2
(SI), gcm/s
2
(CGS), and
lb
m
ft/s
2
(U.S. customary). To avoid having to carry around these complex units in all calculations
involving forces,derived force unitshave been defined in each system. In the metric systems, the
derived force units (thenewtonin SI, thedynein the CGS system) are defined to equal the natural
units:
1 newtonN1kgm/s
2
(2.4-1)
1 dyne1gcm/s
2
(2.4-2)
In U.S. customary units, the derived force unit—called apound-force(lb
f
)—is defined as the
product of a unit mass (1 lb
m
) and the acceleration of gravity at sea level and 45°latitude, which is
32.174 ft/s

denoted byg).
10CHAPTER 2Introduction to Engineering Calculations

Theweightof an object is the force exerted on the object by gravitational attraction. Suppose
that an object of massmis subjected to a gravitational forceW(Wis by definition the weight of the
object) and that if this object were falling freely its acceleration would beg. The weight, mass, and
free-fall acceleration of the object are related by Equation 2.4-4:
Wmg(2.4-4)
The gravitational acceleration (g) varies directly with the mass of the attracting body (the earth, in
most problems you will confront) and inversely with the square of the distance between the centers
of mass of the attracting body and the object being attracted. The value ofgat sea level and 45°
latitude is given below in each system of units:
g9:8066 m/s

980:66 cm/s
2
32:174 ft/s
2
(2.4-5)
The acceleration of gravity does not vary much with position on the earth’s surface and (within
moderate limits) altitude, and the values in Equation 2.4-5 may accordingly be used for most
conversions between mass and weight.

2.5NUMERICAL CALCULATION AND ESTIMATION
2.5a  Scientific Notation, Significant Figures, and Precision
Both very large and very small numbers are commonly encountered in process calculations. A
convenient way to represent such numbers is to usescientific notation, in which a number is
expressed as the product of another number (usually between 0.1 and 10) and a power of 10.
Examples:
123;000;0001:2310
8
or 0:12310
9

0:0000282:810
5
or 0:2810
4

Thesignificantfiguresof a number are the digits from thefirst nonzero digit on the left to
either (a) the last digit (zero or nonzero) on the right if there is a decimal point, or (b) the last
nonzero digit of the number if there is no decimal point. For example,
2300 or 2:310
3
has two significantfigures.
2300. or 2:30010
3
has four significantfigures.
2300.0 or 2:300010
3
hasfive significantfigures.
23,040 or 2:30410
4
has four significantfigures.
0.035 or 3:510
2
has two significantfigures.
0.03500 or 3:50010
2
has four significantfigures.
(Note:The number of significantfigures is easily shown and seen if scientific notation is used.)
The number of significantfigures in the reported value of a measured or calculated quantity
provides an indication of the precision with which the quantity is known: the more significant
figures, the more precise is the value. Generally, if you report the value of a measured quantity
with three significantfigures, you indicate that the value of the third of thesefigures may be off by
as much as a half-unit. Thus, if you report a mass as 8.3 g (two significantfigures), you indicate
that the mass lies somewhere between 8.25 and 8.35 g, whereas if you give the value as 8.300 g
(four significantfigures) you indicate that the mass lies between 8.2995 and 8.3005 g.
Note, however, that this rule applies only to measured quantities or numbers calculated from
measured quantities. If a quantity is known precisely—like a pure integer (2) or a counted rather
than  measured  quantity  (16  oranges)—its  value  implicitly  contains  an  infinite  number  of
significantfigures (5 cows really means 5.0000 . . . cows).
When two or more quantities are combined by multiplication and/or division, the number of
significantfigures in the result should equal the lowest number of significantfigures of any of the
multiplicands or divisors. If the initial result of a calculation violates this rule, you must round off
the result to reduce the number of significantfigures to its maximum allowed value, although if
several calculations are to be performed in sequence it is advisable to keep extra significantfigures
of intermediate quantities and to round off only thefinal result. Examples:

(The raised quantities in parentheses denote the number of significantfigures in the given numbers.)
Warning:If you calculate, say, 34, and your calculator or computer gives you an answer like
11.99999, and you copy this answer and hand it in, your instructor may become hysterical!
The rule for addition and subtraction concerns the position of the last significantfigure in the
sum—that is, the location of thisfigure relative to the decimal point. The rule is:When two or more
numbers are added or subtracted, the positions of the last significantfigures of each number
12CHAPTER 2Introduction to Engineering Calculations

relative to the decimal point should be compared. Of these positions, the one farthest to the left is
the position of the last permissible significantfigure of the sum or difference.
Several examples of this rule follow, in which an arrow (↓) denotes the last significantfigure
of each number.

equally important, and serious problems can arise when it is not asked. All successful engineers
get into the habit of asking it whenever they solve a problem and they develop a wide variety of
strategies for answering it.
Among  approaches  you  can  use  to  validate  a  quantitative  problem  solution  areback-
substitution, order-of-magnitude estimation, andthe test of reasonableness.
Back-substitution is straightforward: after you solve a set of equations, substitute your solution
back into the equations and make sure it works.
Order-of-magnitude estimation means coming up with a crude and easy-to-obtain approxima-
tion of the answer to a problem and making sure that the more exact solution comes reasonably
close to it.
Applying  the  test  of  reasonableness  means  verifying  that  the  solution  makes  sense.  If,  for
example, a calculated velocity of waterflowing in a pipe is faster than the speed of light or the
calculated temperature in a chemical reactor is higher than the interior temperature of the sun,
you should suspect that a mistake has been made somewhere.
The procedure for checking an arithmetic calculation by order-of-magnitude estimation is as
follows:
1.Substitute simple integers for all numerical quantities, using powers of 10 (scientific notation)
for very small and very large numbers.

The third way to check a numerical result—and perhaps thefirst thing you should do when you get
one—is to see if the answer is reasonable. If, for example, you calculate that a cylinder contains
4:2310
32
kg of hydrogen when the mass of the sun is only 210
30
kg, it should motivate you to
redo the calculation. You should similarly be concerned if you calculate a reactor volume larger than
the earth (10
21
m
3
) or a room temperature hot enough to melt iron (1535°C). If you get in the habit of
asking yourself,“Does this make sense?”every time you come up with a solution to a problem—in
engineering and in the rest of your life—you will spare yourself considerable grief and embarrassment.
A  sure  way  to  embarrass  yourself  is  to  report  the  result  of  a  calculation  with  excessive
significantfigures. For example, suppose you calculate that the required volume of a large vessel
to be used in the production of a new bioproduct by fermentation is 1151.6 L. You may, in fact,
have done all calculations correctly and had sufficient significantfigures to include the 6 to the
right of the decimal. Unless you really mean that a volume of that precision is required (which is
inconceivable), you should not present it without comment to your colleagues, boss, vendor, or
course instructor. Thus, at the end of your calculations, do something like the following:

2.5c Estimation of Measured Values: Sample Mean
Suppose we carry out a chemical reaction of the form A→Products, starting with pure A in the
reactor and keeping the reactor temperature constant at 45°C. After two minutes we draw a sample
from the reactor and analyze it to determineX, the percentage of the A fed that has reacted.
Coolant

control)
Sample

Analyzer
T (temperature)
X (% conversion)
In  theoryXshould  have  a  unique  value;  however,  in  a  real  reactorXis  arandom variable,
changing in an unpredictable manner from one run to another at the same experimental conditions.
The values ofXobtained after 10 successive runs might be as follows:
Run12345678910
X(%)67.173.169.667.471.068.269.468.268.770.2
Why don’t we get the same value ofXin each run? There are several reasons.
It is impossible to replicate experimental conditions exactly in successive experiments. If the
temperature in the reactor varies by as little as 0.1 degree from one run to another, it could be
enough to change the measured value ofX.
Even if conditions were identical in two runs, we could not possibly draw our sample at exactly
t2:000...minutes  both  times,  and  a  difference  of  a  second  could  make  a  measurable
difference inX.
Variations  in  sampling  and  chemical  analysis  procedures  invariably  introduce  scatter  in
measured values.
We might ask two questions about the system at this point.
2.5  Numerical Calculation and Estimation15

1.What is the true value of X?
In principle there may be such a thing as the“true value”—that is, the value we would
measure if we could set the temperature exactly to 45.0000 . . . degrees, start the reaction, keep
the temperature and all other experimental variables that affectXperfectly constant, and then
sample and analyze with complete accuracy at exactlyt2:0000...minutes. In practice there
is no way to do any of those things, however. We could also define the true value ofXas the
value we would calculate by performing an infinite number of measurements and averaging the
results, but there is no practical way to do that either. The best we can ever do is toestimatethe
true value ofXfrom afinite number of measured values.
2.How can we estimate the true value of X?
The  most  common  estimate  is  thesample mean(orarithmetic mean).  We  collectN
measured values ofXX

The more measurements of a random variable, the better the estimated value based on the
sample mean. However, even with a huge number of measurements the sample mean is at best
an approximation of the true value and could in fact be way off (e.g., if there is something
wrong with the instruments or procedures used to measureX).

2.If you used the sample mean of the given data as a basis, what would you predict the next

3.Come up with a better prediction, and explain your reasoning.
2.5d  Sample Variance of Scattered Data
Consider two sets of measurements of the percentage conversion (X) in the same batch reactor
measured using two different experimental techniques. Scatter plots ofXversus run number are
shown in Figure 2.5-1. The sample mean of each set is 70%, but the measured values scatter over a
much narrower range for thefirst set (from 68% to 73%) than for the second set (from 52% to 88%).
16CHAPTER 2Introduction to Engineering Calculations

In each case you would estimate the true value ofXfor the given experimental conditions as the
sample mean, 70%, but you would clearly have more confidence in the estimate for Set (a) than in
that for Set (b).
Three quantities—therange, thesample variance, and thesample standard deviation—are
used to express the extent to which values of a random variable scatter about their mean value. The
rangeis simply the difference between the highest and lowest values of X in the data set:
Range:RX

(2.5-2)
In thefirst plot of Figure 2.5-1 the range ofXis 5%73%68%and in the second plot it is
36%88%52%.
The range is the crudest measure of scatter: it involves only two of the measured values and
gives no indication of whether or not most of the values cluster close to the mean or scatter widely
around it. Thesample varianceis a much better measure. To define it we calculate thedeviationof
each measured value from the sample mean,X

The more a measured value (X

and hence the greater the value of the sample variance and sample
standard deviation. If these quantities are calculated for the data sets of Figure 2.5-1, for example,
relatively  small  values  are  obtained  for  Set  (a)(s

X
0:99)  and  large  values  are
obtained for Set (b)(s

X

11:5).
For typical random variables, roughly two-thirds of all measured values fall within one standard
deviation of the mean; about 88% fall within two standard deviations; and about 99% fall within three
standard deviations.

A graphical illustration of this statement is shown in Figure 2.5-2. Of the
37 measured values ofX, 27 fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 33 within two standard
deviations, and 36 within three standard deviations.
Values of measured variables are often reported with error limits, such asX48:20:6.
This statement means that a single measured value ofXis likely to fall between 47.6 and 48.8. The
midpoint of the range (X48:2) is almost always the mean value of the data set used to generate
this result; however, the significance of the given error limits (0:6) is not obvious unless more

The  exact  percentages  depend  on  how  the  measured  values  are  distributed  about  the  mean—whether  they  follow  a
Gaussian (normal) distribution, for example—and how many points are in the data set used to calculate the mean and
standard deviation.

). IfYexceeds this value, the process is shut down for remedial maintenance (a long and
costly procedure). Such large deviations from the mean might occur as part of the normal scatter of the
process,  but  so  infrequently  that  if  it  happens  the  existence  of  an  abnormal  problem  in  the  process  is
considered the more likely explanation.

simply reflecting normal scatter in the process.
2.6DIMENSIONAL HOMOGENEITY AND DIMENSIONLESS QUANTITIES
We began our discussion of units and dimensions by saying that quantities can be added and
subtracted only if their units are the same. If the units are the same, it follows that the dimensions
of each term must be the same. For example, if two quantities can be expressed in terms of grams/
second, both must have the dimension (mass/time). This suggests the following rule:
Every valid equation must be dimensionally homogeneous: that is, all additive terms on both sides
of the equation must have the same dimensions.
Consider the equation
uu
0
gt(2.6-1)
where bothuandu
0
have dimensions length/time,ghas dimensions of length/time
2
, andtis time.
A simple check shows that each of the three groups of terms has dimensions of length/time, and
therefore the equation is dimensionally homogeneous; on the other hand,uu
0
gis not (why
not?) and consequently cannot be a valid relationship.
While Equation 2.6-1 is dimensionally homogeneous, the units of each additive term must be
identical for the equation to be valid. For instance, suppose that calculations using Equation 2.6-1
have been proceeding with time in seconds, but a new batch of data expressestin minutes. The
equation must then be written as
um/su
0
m/sgm/s
2
tmin60 s/min
The converse of the given rule is not necessarily true—an equation may be dimensionally
homogeneous and invalid. For example, ifMis the mass of an object, then the equationM2Mis
dimensionally homogeneous, but it is also obviously incorrect except for one specific value ofM.

2.Write expressions for each old variable in terms of the corresponding new variable.
3.Substitute these expressions in the original equation and simplify.

2.7PROCESS DATA REPRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS
The  operation  of  any  chemical  process  is  ultimately  based  on  the  measurement  of  process
variables—temperatures, pressures,flow rates, concentrations, and so on. It is sometimes possible
to measure these variables directly, but, as a rule, indirect techniques must be used.
Suppose, for example, that you wish to measure the concentration,C, of a solute in a solution.
To do so, you normally measure a quantity,X—such as a thermal or electrical conductivity, a light
absorbance, or the volume of a titer—that varies in a known manner withC, and then calculateC
from the measured value ofX. The relationship betweenCandXis determined in a separate
calibrationexperiment  in  which  solutions  of  known  concentration  are  prepared  andXis
measured for each solution.
Consider  a  calibration  in  which  a  variable,y,  is  measured  for  several  values  of  another
variable,x:
x1.02.03.04.0
y0.30.71.21.8
In the terms of thefirst paragraph,ymight be a reactant concentration or some other process
variable  andxwould  be  a  readily  measured  quantity  (such  as  conductivity)  whose  value
correlates with the value ofy. Our object is to use the calibrationdatatoestimatethevalueof
yfor a value ofxbetween tabulated points (interpolation)oroutsidetherangeofthetable
data (extrapolation).
A number of interpolation and extrapolation methods are commonly used, including two-
point linear interpolation, graphical interpolation, and curvefitting. Which one is most appropriate
depends on the nature of the relationship betweenxandy.
Figure 2.7-1 shows several illustrative (x,y) plots. If the plot of a given data set looks like that
shown in plot (a)or(b) of thisfigure, a straight line would probably befitted to the data and used as
the basis for subsequent interpolation or extrapolation. On the other hand, if the plot is distinctly
2.7  Process Data Representation and Analysis21

curved as in plot (c), a curve could be drawn in by inspection and used as the basis of interpolation,
or straight-line segments could befitted to successive pairs of points, or a nonlinear functionyx
thatfits the data could be sought.
The technique of drawing a line or curve through the data by inspection is self-explanatory.
The other methods are reviewed in the sections that follow.

If the points in a table are relatively close together, linear interpolation should provide an
accurate estimate ofyfor anyxand vice versa; on the other hand, if the points are widely separated
or if the data are to be extrapolated, one of the curve-fitting techniques to be outlined in the next

2.7c  Fitting Nonlinear Data
During a recent week at a major university, 423 experimenters separately measured and plotted
data and found that their data points did not lie on straight points; 416 of these people shrugged
their shoulders, said“Close enough,”and drew a line anyway; and the other seven went about
finding an equation other thany=ax+bto relate the variables.
Fitting a nonlinear equation (anything butyaxb) to data is usually much harder than
fitting a line; however, with some nonlinear equations you can still use straight-linefitting if you
plot the data in a suitable manner. Suppose, for example, thatxandyare related by the equation
y
2
ax
3
b. A plot of measuredyversusxdata would clearly be curved; however, a plot ofy
2
versusx
3
would be a straight line  with a slopeaand interceptb. More generally,  if any two
quantities are related by an equation of the form
Quantity 1aQuantity 2b
then a plot of thefirst quantity (y
2
in the above example) versus the second (x
3
) on rectangular
coordinates yields a straight line with slopeaand interceptb.
Here are several additional examples of plots that yield straight lines:

2.7d  Logarithmic Coordinates
Suppose  you  wish  tofit  an  exponential  functionyaexpbxto  measured  (x,y)data.The
determination ofaandbis simplified by plotting lnyas a function ofx. There are two plotting
26CHAPTER 2Introduction to Engineering Calculations

procedures  you  might  use:  (1)  calculate  lnyfor  each  value  ofy,  and  plot  lnyversusxon
rectangular axes, or (2) plotydirectly on alogarithmic scaleversusxon a rectangular scale.
Figure 2.7-2 illustrates the creation of a logarithmic scale, drawn parallel to a rectangular scale
for lny. All the values on the rectangular lnyscale are the natural logarithms of the adjacent
values on the logarithmicyscale; conversely, all values on theyscale are the exponentials of the
values on the lnyscale (that is,eraised to those values). Once you have theyscale, instead of
having to calculate lnyfor each tabulatedyto plot the data points on the rectangular axis, you
can  directly  locate  and  plot  theyvalues  on  the  logarithmic  scale.  If  you  wanted  to  plot  a
dependent  variable  versus  lnxon  a  rectangular  scale,  you  could  draw  a  logarithmic  scale
parallel to the horizontal axis and plotxdirectly on it, avoiding the need to calculate lnxfor
each tabulatedxvalue. A plot with logarithmic scales on both axes is called alog plot,anda
plot with one logarithmic axis and one rectangular (equal interval) axis is called asemilog plot.
At one time, use of special graph paper in either log or semilog form was an essential feature
of  data  graphing  and  analysis.  Now,  however,  many  computer  programs  (such  as  Excel  and
Kaleidagraph) will plot data using whatever type of graph you choose.
In short,plotting values of a variable on a logarithmic scale in effect plots the logarithms of
the variable on a rectangular scale. Suppose, for example, thatyandxare related by the equation
yaexpbx, or equivalently, lnylnabx. To determineaandbyou may plotyversusxon
a semilog plot, choosing two points (x
1
;y

) and (x
2
;y
2
) on the resulting line, or you may plot
lnyversusxon rectangular axes, drawing the line through the corresponding two points (x

;lny

)
and (x
2

2
). In either case,bandaare obtained as

In summary,
1.Ifyversusxdata  appear  linear on a  semilog  plot,  then  lnyversusxwould be  linear  on  a
rectangular  plot,  and  the  data  can  therefore  be  correlated  by  an  exponential  function

2.7e Fitting a Line to Scattered Data
There is little problemfitting a line to data that look like this:
y
x
Life being the way it is, however, you are much more likely to come up with something more like
this:
y
x
When data points are scattered, you can draw any number of lines that appear tofit the points equally
well (or equally poorly, depending on your point of view). The question is which line to use.
A number of statistical techniques exist forfitting a function to a set of scattered data. The
application of the most common of these techniques—linear regressionor themethod of least
squares—to thefitting of a straight line to a series ofyversusxdata points is outlined and illustrated
in Appendix A.1, and the use of this technique is required for the solution of Problems 2.48 through
2.53 at the end of this chapter. Alternatively, suchfitting of an equation to data can be accomplished
with commercial software (such as Excel and Kaleidagraph) and even on some calculators.
2.8  SUMMARY
This chapter introduces some fundamental problem-solving tools
that  you  will  need  in  the  rest  of  this  course,  in  subsequent
engineering and science courses, and almost every time in your
career  when  you  perform  mathematical  calculations.  The  main
points of the chapter are as follows.
You can convert a quantity expressed in one set of units into
its equivalent in other dimensionally consistent units using
conversion factors, like those in the table on the inside front
cover of the text.
Aweightis  the  force  exerted  on  anobject  by  gravitational
attraction. The weight of an object of massmmay be calculated
asWmg,wheregis the acceleration of gravity at the location of
the   object.   At   sea   level   on   the   earth,g9:8066 m/s
2

32:174 ft/s
2
. To convert a weight (or any force) in natural units
like kgm/s
2
or lb
m
ft/s
2
to its equivalent in a derived force unit like
Norlb
f
, use the conversion factor table.
The significantfigures (s.f.) with which a number is reported
specify  the  precision  with  which  the  number  is  known.  For
2.8  Summary29

instance,x3:0  (2  s.f.)  states  thatxis  somewhere  between
2.95 and 3.05, whilex3:000 (4 s.f.) states that it is between
2.9995 and 3.0005. When you multiply and divide numbers,
the number of significantfigures of the result equals the lowest
number of significantfigures of any of the factors. In complex
calculations, keep the maximum number of significantfigures
until thefinal result is obtained, then round off.
IfXis a measured process variable, thesample meanof a set of
measured values,
X, is the average of the set (the sum of the
values divided by the number of values). It is an estimate of the
true mean, the value that would be obtained by averaging an
infinite number of measurements. Thesamplevarianceof the set,
s
2
X
, is a measure of the spread of the measured values about the
sample mean. It is calculated from Equation (2.5-3). Thesample
standard deviation,s
X
, is the square root of the sample variance.
If
Xands
X
are determined from a set of normal process runs
and a subsequently measured value ofXfalls more than 2s
X
away from
X, the chances are that something has changed in the
process—there is less than a 10% chance that normal scatter can
account for the deviation. If the deviation is greater than 3s
X
,
there is less than a 1% chance that normal scatter is the cause.
The exact percentages depend on how the measured values are
distributed about the mean—whether they follow a Gaussian
distribution, for example—and how many points are in the data
set used to calculate the mean and standard deviation.
Suppose you are given a set of values of a dependent variable,
y, corresponding to values of an independent variable,x, and
you wish to estimateyfor a specifiedx. You can either assume a
straight-line dependence for the two data points that bracket the
specifiedxand use two-point linear interpolation (Equation 2.7-1)
orfit  a  function  to  the  data  points  and  use  it  for  the  desired
estimation.
If (x;y) data appear to scatter about a straight line on a plot ofy
versusx, you mayfit a line using Equations (2.7-3) and (2.7-4)
or, for greater precision and an estimate of the goodness of the
fit, use the method of least squares (Appendix A.1). If a plot ofy
versusxis  nonlinear,  you  may  try  tofit  various  nonlinear
functions  by  plotting  functions  ofxandyin  a  manner  that
should yield a straight line. For example, tofit a functiony
2

a/xbto (x;y) data, ploty
2
versus 1/x. If thefit is good, the
plot should be a straight line with slopeaand interceptb.
Plottingy(log scale) versusx(linear scale) on a semilog plot is
equivalent to plotting lnyversusxon rectangular axes. If the
plot is linear in either case,xandyare related by an exponential
function,yae
bx
.
Plottingyversusxon  logarithmic  axes  is  equivalent  to
plotting  lnyversus  lnxon  rectangular  axes.  If  the  plot  is
linear  in  either  case,xandyare  related  by  a  power  law
function,yax

During  the  early  part  of  the  20th  century,  sulfanilamide  (an  antibacterial  drug)  was  only
administered  by  injection  or  in  a  solid  pill.  In  1937,  a  pharmaceutical  company  decided  to
market a liquid formulation of the drug. Since sulfanilamide was known to be highly insoluble in
water and other common pharmaceutical solvents, a number of alternative solvents were tested
and the drug was found to be soluble in diethylene glycol (DEG). After satisfactory results were
obtained in tests offlavor, appearance, and fragrance, 240 gallons of sulfanilamide in DEG were
manufactured and marketed as Elixir Sulfanilamide. After a number of deaths were determined to
have  been  caused  by  the  formulation,  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  mounted  a
campaign to recall the drug and recovered about 232 gallons. By this time, 107 people had died.
The incident led to passage of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that significantly
tightened FDA safety requirements.
Not all of the quantities needed in solving the following problems can be found in the text. Give
sources of such information and list all assumptions.
(a)The dosage instructions for the elixir were to“take 2 to 3 teaspoons in water every four hours.”
Assume each teaspoon was pure DEG, and estimate the volume (mL) of DEG a patient would have
consumed in a day.
(b)The lethal  oral dose of diethylene glycol has been estimated to be 1.4 mL DEG/kg body mass.
Determine the maximum patient mass (lb

2.22.Two thermocouples (temperature measurement devices) are tested by inserting their probes in boiling
water, recording the readings, removing and drying the probes, and then doing it again. The results of
five measurements are as follows:

2.23.Product quality assurance (QA) is a particularly tricky business in the dye manufacturing industry. A
slight variation in reaction conditions can lead to a measurable change in the color of the product, and
since customers usually require extremely high color reproducibility from one shipment to another,
even a small color change can lead to rejection of a product batch.
Suppose  the  various  color  frequency  and  intensity  values  that  comprise  a  color  analysis  are
combined into a single numerical value,C, for a particular yellow dye. During a test period in which
the reactor conditions are carefully controlled and the reactor is thoroughly cleaned between successive
batches (not the usual procedure), product analyses of 12 batches run on successive days yield the
following color readings:
Batch123456789101112
C74.371.872.073.175.172.675.373.474.872.673.073.7
(a)The  QA  specification  for  routine  production  is  that  a  batch  that  falls  more  than  two  standard
deviations away from the test period mean must be rejected and sent for reworking. Determine the
minimum and maximum acceptable values ofC.
(b)A statistician working in quality assurance and a production engineer are having an argument. One of
them, Frank, wants to raise the QA specification to three standard deviations and the other, Joanne,
wants to lower it to one. Reworking is time-consuming, expensive, and very unpopular with the
engineers who have to do it. Who is more likely to be the statistician and who the engineer? Explain.
(c)Suppose  that  in  thefirst  few  weeks  of  operation  relatively  few  unacceptable  batches  are
produced, but then the number begins to climb steadily. Think of up tofive possible causes,
and state how you might go about determining whether or not each of them might in fact be
responsible for the drop in quality.

2.24.Your company manufactures plastic wrap for food storage. The tear resistance of the wrap, denoted by
X, must be controlled so that the wrap can be torn off the roll without too much effort but it does not tear
too easily when in use.
In a series of test runs, 15 rolls of wrap are made under carefully controlled conditions and the tear
resistance  of  each  roll  is  measured.  The  results  are  used  as  the  basis  of  aquality assurance
specification(see Problem 2.23). IfXfor a subsequently produced roll falls more than two standard
deviations  away  from  the  test  period  average,  the  process  is  declared  out  of  specification  and
production is suspended for routine maintenance.

Bacteria can serve as catalysts for the conversion of low-cost chemicals, such as glucose, into higher
value  compounds,  including  commodity  chemicals  (with  large  production  rates)  and  high-value
specialty chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, and cosmetics. Commodity chemicals are produced
from bacteria in very large bioreactors. For example, cultures up to 130,000 gallons are used to produce
antibiotics and other therapeutics, industrial enzymes, and polymer intermediates.
When a healthy bacteria culture is placed in a suitable environment with abundant nutrients, the
bacteria experience balanced growth, meaning that they continue to double in number in the samefixed

2.41.L-Serine is an amino acid important for its roles in synthesizing other amino acids and for its use in
intravenous feeding solutions. It is often synthesized commercially by fermentation, and recovered by
subjecting the fermentation broth to several processing steps and then crystallizing the serine from an
aqueous  solution.  The  solubilities  of  L-serine  (L-Ser)  in  water  have  been  measured  at  several
temperatures, producing the following data:

Processes and Process
Variables
Aprocessis any operation or series of operations by which a particular objective is accomplished.
In  this  textbook,  we  address  those  operations  that  cause  a  physical  or  chemical  change  in  a
substance or mixture of substances. The material that enters a process is referred to as theinputor
feed, and that which leaves is theoutputorproduct. It is common for processes to consist of
multiple steps, each of which is carried out in aprocess unit, and each process unit has associated
with it a set of input and outputprocess streams.
As a chemical engineer, you are likely to be called upon todesignoroperatea process.Design
includes formulation of a processflowchart (layout) as well as specification of individual process
units (such as reactors, equipment to separate mixtures into their constituents, heat exchangers,
pumps, and compressors) and associated process variables that specify the conditions at which the
units are to be operated. In design, engineers usually work with a hypothetical process that has yet to
be constructed.Operationinvolves the day-to-day performance of an existing process. The process
is expected to produce a product at a specified rate with specified characteristics, and the engineer’s
tasks may involve controlling the individual units so that these objectives are met.
In addition to carrying out those two activities, you may be called upon to perform process
analysis, with objectives that may vary from one process to another. For example, a task might be
to  identify  ways  to  reduce  costs  associated  with  raw  materials  and  energy  consumption.  The
methodology could involve controlled tests on the actual process or a scaled-down version of it, or
it may require developing a mathematical model to predict process outcomes at different operating
conditions. Often, a combination of these approaches is used.
Examination of an operating process should be ongoing, but there is a special need when the
process is functioning poorly andtroubleshootingis required to identify the cause of the problem.
Sometimes an increase in market demand requires an increase in production rate, and the required
increase exceeds the capacity of the existing equipment. Identifying and modifying a step in the
process that is limiting the production rate in order to obtain greater throughput is referred to as
debottlenecking.  When  demand  for  the  product  falls,  adjusting  the  process  throughturndown
becomes important.
The links among all of the activities and functions described in the preceding discussion are
the process streams connecting process units and forming the processflowchart. Performance of
the functions requires knowledge of the amounts, compositions, and conditions of the process
streams and materials within the process units. You must be able to measure or calculate such
information for existing units or specify and calculate it for units being designed.
In this chapter we present definitions, illustrative measurement techniques, and methods of
calculating variables that characterize the operation of processes and individual process units. In
later chapters, we discuss how you can use the measured values of some of these variables to
calculate process-related quantities that cannot be measured directly but must be known before the
process can be fully designed or evaluated.
3.0LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Explain in your own words and without the use of jargon (a) the difference between density and

necessarily 1 atm.
Calculate the density in g/cm

Calculate two of the quantities—mass (or massflow rate), volume (or volumetricflow rate),
and moles (or molarflow rate)—from a knowledge of the third quantity for any species of
known density and molecular weight.
Given  the  composition  of  a  mixture  expressed  in  terms  of  mass  fractions,  calculate  the
composition in terms of mole fractions, and vice versa.
Determine the average molecular weight of a mixture from the mass or molar composition of
the mixture.
Convert a pressure expressed as a head of afluid to the equivalent pressure expressed as a force
per unit area, and vice versa.
Convert a manometer reading into a pressure difference for an open-end manometer, a sealed-

Convert among temperatures expressed in K,°C,°F, and°R.
3.1MASS AND VOLUME
Thedensityof  a  substance  is  the  mass  per  unit  volume  of  the  substance  (kg/m
3
,g/cm
3
,
lb
m
/ft
3
,etc.)Thespecificvolumeof a substance is the volume occupied by a unit mass of the
substance;  it  is  the  inverse  ofdensity.  Densities  of  pure  solids  and  liquids  are  essentially
independent  of  pressure  and  vary  relativelyslightly  with  temperature.  The  variation  with
temperature may be in either direction: the density of liquidwater, for example, increases
from 0.999868 g/cm
3
at 0°C to 1.00000 g/cm
3
at 3.98°C, and then decreases to 0.95838 g/cm
3
at  100°C.  Densities  of  many  pure  compounds,  solutions,  and  mixtures  may  be  found  in
standard references (such asPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook,
1
pp. 2-7 through 2-47
and 2-96 through 2-123). Methods of estimating densities of gases and mixtures of liquids are
given in Chapter 5 of this book.
The density of a substance can be used as a conversion factor to relate the mass and the volume of
a quantity of the substance. For example, the density of carbon tetrachloride is 1.595 g/cm
3
; the mass
of 20.0 cm

of CCl

is therefore

If you are given the specific gravity of a substance, multiply it by the reference density in any
units to get the density of the substance in the same units. For example, if the specific gravity of a
liquid is 2.00, its density is 2:0010

or 2.00 g/cm

or 125 lb

. Specific gravities of
selected liquids and solids are given in Table B.1.
You can retrieve the specific gravity values tabulated in Table B.1 using the SG(“species”)
function of APEx (see p. iv of the Preface). For example, if you enter the formula=SG(“acetone”)
into a cell of a spreadsheet, the value 0.791 will be inserted into the cell.
Note:Special density units called degrees Baumé (°Bé), degrees API (°API), and degrees Twaddell
(°Tw) are occasionally used, particularly in the petroleum industry. Definitions of and conversion
factors for these units are given on p. 1-19 ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook.

3.2FLOW RATE
3.2a  Mass and Volumetric Flow Rate
Most processes involve the movement of material from one point to another—sometimes between
process units, sometimes between a production facility and a transportation depot. The rate at
which a material is transported through a process line is theflow rateof that material.
Theflow rate of a process stream may be expressed as amassflow rate(mass/time) or as a
volumetricflow rate(volume/time). Suppose afluid (gas or liquid)flows in the cylindrical pipe
shown below, where the shaded area represents a section perpendicular to the direction offlow.

Thus,the density of afluid can be used to convert a known volumetricflow rate of a process stream

frequently more convenient to measure volumetricflow rates. A common procedure is therefore to

3.2b  Flow Rate Measurement
Aflowmeteris a device mounted in a process line that provides a continuous reading of theflow
rate  in  the  line.  Two  commonly  usedflowmeters—therotameterand  theorifice meter—are
shown schematically in Figure 3.2-1.Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook, pp. 10-14 through
10-24, describes many others.
The rotameter is a tapered vertical tube containing afloat; the larger theflow rate, the higher
thefloat rises in the tube. The orifice meter measures the pressure drop across an orifice (a small
opening) in a thin plate restricting theflow in a conduit. Fluidflows through the orifice, and the
pressure decreases from the upstream side of the orifice to the downstream side. The pressure
difference, which varies withflow rate, may be measured with a number of devices, including a
differential manometer, which is discussed in the next section. The greater theflow rate, the larger
the pressure drop.

CREATIVITY EXERCISE
Given below is thefirst of a series of exercises contained in this book that we call Creativity
Exercises. These exercises differ considerably from the kinds of problems you are accustomed to
seeing in homework assignments and quizzes. In the latter, you are generally given information
and asked tofind the single correct solution to a problem. In the creativity exercises, you are asked
to think of many possible responses without spending too much time doing so. There is no such
thing as the“correct”response or even a“good”or“bad”response. The idea is to go for quantity
rather  than  quality,  imagination  (even  humor)  rather  than“correctness.”Try  to  suspend  your
critical judgment completely and come up with as many ideas as you can, regardless of how likely
they are to be efficient, cost-effective, or even to work at all.
In many situations, this“brainstorming”approach to creative problem solving is frequently
used as thefirst step in solving difficult problems. Doing these exercises will help sharpen the
skills you will need for successful brainstorming and at the same time will give you a broader
understanding of the concepts contained in the text.
Here, then, is thefirst exercise. Invent as many devices as you can that might function as
flowmeters  for  gases  or  liquids.  In  each  case,  describe  the  device  and  state  what  would  be
measured. (Example:Put a propeller in aflowing stream and measure its rotational speed.)
3.3CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
Most materials encountered in nature and in chemical process systems are mixtures of various
species. The physical properties of a mixture depend strongly on the mixture composition. In this
section we will review different ways to express mixture compositions, and later in the book we
will outline methods of estimating physical properties of a mixture from the properties of the pure
components.

3.3a  Moles and Molecular Weight
Theatomic weightof an element is the mass of an atom on a scale that assigns
12
C (the isotope of
carbon whose nucleus contains six protons and six neutrons) a mass of exactly 12. The atomic
weights of all the elements in their naturally occurring isotopic proportions are listed in the table at
the back cover of the book. Themolecular weightof a compound is the sum of the atomic weights
of the atoms that constitute a molecule of the compound: atomic oxygen (O), for example, has an
atomic weight of approximately 16, and therefore molecular oxygen (O
2
) has a molecular weight
of approximately 32. Molecular weights of a number of compounds are given in Table B.1. You
can retrieve the molecular weight of a compound with the APEx function=MW(“species”). For
example, if you enter=MW(“oxygen”)or=MW(“O2”) in a spreadsheet cell, the value 32 will be
returned.
Agram-mole(g-mole ormolin SI units) of a species is the amount of that species whose mass
in grams is numerically equal to its molecular weight. (If the species is an element, it is technically
correct to refer to a gram-atom rather than a gram-mole. We will not observe this distinction, but will
use  moles  for  both  elements  and  compounds.)  Other  types  of  moles  (e.g.,  kg-moles  or  kmol,
lb-moles, ton-moles) are similarly defined. Carbon monoxide (CO), for example, has a molecular
weight of 28; 1 mol of CO therefore contains 28 g, l lb-mole contains 28 lb
m
, 1 ton-mole contains
28 tons, and so on.
If the molecular weight of a substance is M,then there are Mkg/kmol,Mg/mol,and
Mlb
m
/lb-moleof this substance. The molecular weight may thus be used as a conversion factor
that relates the mass and the number of moles of a quantity of the substance. For example, 34 kg of
ammonia (NH
3
:M17) is equivalent to
34 kg NH
3
1 kmol NH

(3.3-2)
(It is often helpful in mass-mole conversions to include the chemical formula in the dimensional
equation, as illustrated above.)
The same factors used to convert masses from one unit to another may be used to convert the
equivalent molar units. Since 454 g/lb
m
is a valid conversion factor, 454 mol/lb-mole must also be
valid,  regardless  of  the  substance  involved.  (Prove  it—convert  1  lb-mole  of  a  substance  with
molecular weightMto gram-moles.)
One gram-mole of any species contains approximately6:0210

A set of mass fractions may be converted to an equivalent set of mole fractions by (a) assuming
as abasis of calculationa mass of the mixture (e.g., 100 kg or 100 lb

); (b) using the known mass
fractions to calculate the mass of each component in the basis quantity, and converting these masses
to moles; and (c) taking the ratio of the moles of each component to the total number of moles. An
analogous procedure is followed to convert mole fractions to mass fractions, differing only in that a
total number of moles (e.g., 100 mol or 100 lb-moles) is taken as a basis of calculation.

The mass of a species is the product of the mass fraction of that species and total mass (basis of 100 g). The
number of moles of a species is the mass of that species divided by the molecular weight of the species.
Finally, the mole fraction of a species is the number of moles of that species divided by the total number of
moles (3.279 mol).
Theaverage molecular weight(or  mean  molecular  weight)  of  a  mixture,

Themolarityof a solution is the value of the molar concentration of the solute expressed in gram-
moles solute/liter solution (e.g., a 2-molar solution of A contains 2 mol A/liter solution).
The concentration of a substance in a mixture or solution can be used as a conversion factor to
relate the mass (or moles) of a component in a sample of the mixture to the sample volume, or to
relate the mass (or molar)flow rate of a component of a continuous stream to the total volumetric
flow rate of the stream. Consider, for example, a 0.02-molar solution of NaOH (i.e., a solution
containing 0.02 mol NaOH/L): 5 L of this solution contains

the given pressure at its base if the pressure at the top were zero. You can thus speak of a pressure

3.4b  Atmospheric Pressure, Absolute Pressure, and Gauge Pressure
The pressure of the atmosphere can be thought of as the pressure at the base of a column offluid

atmospheric pressure, assuming that the pressure at the top of the columnP
0

gare average values of the density of air and the acceleration of gravity between the top of the
atmosphere and the measurement point.
A typical value of the atmospheric pressure at sea level,760.0mmHg,has been designated as
a standard pressure of 1 atmosphere.  The  conversion  table  on  the  inside  front  cover  lists
equivalent values of this pressure in various units.
Thefluid pressures referred to so far are allabsolute pressures, in that a pressure of zero
corresponds to a perfect vacuum. Many pressure-measuring devices give thegauge pressureof a
fluid, or the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. A gauge pressure of zero indicates that the
absolute pressure of thefluid is equal to atmospheric pressure. The relationship for converting
between absolute and gauge pressure is

We limit our discussion here to Bourdon gauges and manometers but you should recognize the
importance of other modern process sensors.
The most common mechanical device used for pressure measurement is aBourdon gauge,
a hollow tube closed at one end and bent into a C configuration. The open end of the tube is
exposed to thefluid whose pressure is to be measured. As the pressure increases, the tube tends to
straighten,  causing  a  pointer  attached  to  the  tube  to  rotate.  The  position  of  the  pointer  on  a
calibrated dial gives thegaugepressure of thefluid. A schematic diagram of a Bourdon gauge is
shown in Figure 3.4-3.
Bourdon gauges are used to measurefluid pressures from nearly perfect vacuums to about
7000  atm.  More  accurate  measurements  of  pressures  below  about  3  atm  are  provided  by
manometers.
A  manometer  is  a  U-shaped  tube  partiallyfilled  with  afluid  of  known  density  (the
manometerfluid). When the ends of the tube are exposed to different pressures, the liquid
level drops in the high-pressure arm and rises in the low-pressure arm. The difference between
the  pressures  can  be  calculated  from  the  measured  difference  between  the  liquid  levels  in
each arm.
Manometers are used in several different ways, as shown in Figure 3.4-4. In each diagram,
pressureP
1
is greater than pressureP
2
.
Figure 3.4-4ashows anopen-end manometer: one end is exposed to afluid whose pressure
is to be measured, and the other is open to the atmosphere. Figure 3.4-4bshows adifferential
manometer, which is used to measure the pressure difference between two points in a process
line. Figure 3.4-4cshows asealed-end manometer, which has a near-vacuum enclosed at one

The formula that relates the pressure differenceP

P
2
to the difference in manometerfluid
levels is based on the principle that thefluid pressure must be the same at any two points at the
same height in a continuousfluid. In particular,the pressure at the height of the lower surface of
a manometerfluid is the same in both arms of the manometer. (See Figure 3.4-5.) Writing and
equating expressions for the pressures at points (a)and(b) in Figure 3.4-5 yields the general
manometer equation

If eitherfluid 1 or 2 is a gas at a moderate pressure (e.g., if one arm is open to the atmosphere),

the correspondingρgdterm in Equation 3.4-5 may be neglected. Ifbothfluids are gases, then the

CREATIVITY EXERCISE
Think of several devices that might be used to measurefluid pressures, being as imaginative as you
can. (Example:Allow a gas at the pressure to be measured tofill a calibrated balloon, and measure
thefinal balloon diameter.)
3.5TEMPERATURE
The temperature of a substance in a particular state of aggregation (solid, liquid, or gas) is a measure
of the average kinetic energy possessed by the molecules of the substance. Since this energy cannot
be measured directly, the temperature must be determined indirectly by measuring some physical
property of the substance whose value depends on temperature in a known manner. Such properties
and the temperature-measuring devices based on them include electrical resistance of a conductor
(resistance thermometer),  voltage  at  the  junction  of  two  dissimilar  metals  (thermocouple),
spectrum of emitted radiation (pyrometer), and volume of afixed mass offluid (thermometer).
Temperature scales can be defined in terms of any of these properties, or in terms of physical
phenomena, such as freezing and boiling, that take place  atfixed temperatures  and pressures.
You might refer, for example, to“the temperature at which the resistivity of a copper wire is
1:9210
6
ohms/cm
3
”or to“the temperature two-thirds of the way from the boiling point of
water at 1 atm to the melting point of NaCl.”
It is convenient to have, in addition to these physical scales, a simple numerical temperature
scale—among other reasons, so that you do not have to use 25 words to give the value of a single
temperature. A defined temperature scale is obtained by arbitrarily assigning numerical values to two
reproducibly measurable temperatures; for example, assign a value of 0 to the freezing point of water
and a value of 100 to the boiling point of water at 1 atm. The assigned values completely specify the
scale, since in addition to locating the two points they specify that the length of a unit temperature
interval (called adegree)is
1
100
of the distance between the two reference points on the scale.
The  two  most  common  temperature  scales  are  defined  using  the  freezing  pointT
f
and
boiling pointT
b
of water at a pressure of 1 atm.
Celsius (or centigrade) scale:T
f
is assigned a value of 0°C, andT
b
is assigned a value of 100°C.
Absolute zero(theoretically the lowest temperature attainable in nature) on this scale falls at
273.15°C.
Fahrenheit scale:T
f
is assigned a value of 32°F, andT
b
is assigned a value of 212°F. Absolute
zero falls at459.67°F.
TheKelvinandRankinescales are defined such that absolute zero has a value of 0 and the size of a
degree is the same as a Celsius degree (Kelvin scale) or a Fahrenheit degree (Rankine scale).
The following relationships may be used to convert a temperature expressed in one defined

A degree can be both a temperature and a temperature interval, a fact that sometimes leads to
confusion. Consider the temperature interval from 0°Cto5°C. There are nine Fahrenheit and nine
Rankine degrees in this interval, and onlyfive Celsius degrees andfive kelvins. An interval of 1 Celsius
degree or kelvin therefore contains 1.8 Fahrenheit or Rankine degrees, leading to the conversion factors

Test Yourself

1.Suppose you were given a glass tube with mercury in it but no scale markings, and you were
given only a beaker of water, a freezer, and a bunsen burner with which to work. How would
you calibrate the thermometer to provide readings in°C?
2.Which is warmer, a temperature of 1°Cor1°F?
3.Which reflects a greater change in temperature, an increase of 1°Cor1°F?

Some authors have proposed varying the position of the degree symbol to indicate whether a temperature or temperature
interval is denoted; that is, 5°C refers to a temperature offive degrees Celsius, and 5C°means an interval offive Celsius
degrees. This idea, while an excellent one in principle, has not caught on, so you will have to get used to making the
distinction yourself from the context in which the unit appears.

you would measure. (Example:Put a guinea pig on a treadmill and measure the rate at which he
runs to keep warm.) (Well, itcouldwork.)

3.6  SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have described how amounts of material,flow
rates,  compositions,  pressures,  and temperatures  are  determined
from direct measurements or calculated from measurements and
physical  properties.  We  also  have  described  how  to  convert
between  different  methods  of  expressing  these  variables.  Here
are some highlights.
Thedensityof a substance is the ratio of its mass to its volume.
For example, the density of liquid acetone at 20°C is 0.791 g/cm
3
,
so that one cubic centimeter of liquid acetone at 20°Chasamass
of 0.791 gram. Density can be thought of as a conversion factor
between  mass  and  volume  or  between  massflow  rate  and
volumetricflow rate.
Thespecific gravityof a substance is the ratio of the density of
the substance to the density of a reference material (typically
water at 4°C). Specific gravities of many liquids and solids are
given  in  Table  B.1,  with  the  reference  density  being  that  of
liquid water at 4°C (1.00 g/cm
3
, 1.00 kg/L, 62.43 lb
m
/ft
3
). The
density of a substance is the product of its specific gravity and
the reference density in the desired units.
Theatomic weightof an element is the mass of an atom of that
element on a scale that assigns
12
C a mass of exactly 12. This
quantity may be refered to as 12 daltons. Atomic weights of the
elements in their naturally occurring isotopic proportions are
listed in the table at the back of the book. Themolecular weight
of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms
that constitute a molecule of that compound.
Agram-moleormolof a compound is the molecular weight of
the compound in grams; for example, 1 mol H
2
O has a mass of
18.01 grams.A pound-moleorlb-moleis the molecular weight
in pounds  mass;  for  example,  1 lb-mole  H
2
O  has  a mass  of
18.01 lb
m
.  The  molecular  weight  of  water  may  therefore  be
expressed as 18.01 g/mol, 18.01 lb
m
/lb-mole, and so on, and it
may be used to convert masses to moles or massflow rates to
molarflow rates, and vice versa.
Themass fractionof a component in a mixture is the ratio of the
mass of the component to the total mass of the mixture. If 100
grams of a mixture  contains 30 grams  of nitrogen, the mass
fraction of nitrogen is 0.30 g N
2
/g mixture. (The word“mix-
ture”usually  is  omitted.)  The  mass  fraction  is  also  0.30 kg
N
2
/kg and 0.30 lb
m
N
2
/lb
m
, and thepercent by massorweight
percentof nitrogen is 30%. Themole fractionof a component is
defined similarly. If 10.0 kmol of a mixture contains 6.0 kmol
of  methanol,  the  mole  fraction  of  methanol  is  0.60  kmol
CH
3
OH/kmol  (=0.60  lb-mole  CH
3
OH/lb-mole),  and  the
mole percent of methanol is 60%.
Theaverage molecular weightof a mixture is the ratio of the
total mass to the total number of moles of all species.
Theconcentrationof a component in a mixture is the ratio of
the  mass  or  moles  of  the  component  to  the  total  mixture
volume.  Themolarityof  a  component  of  a  solution  is  the
concentration of the component expressed in mol/L.
Thepressureat a point in afluid (gas or liquid) is the force
per unit area that thefluid would exert on a plane surface
passing through the point. Standard units offluid pressure
are N/m
2
(pascal, or Pa) in the SI system, dyne/cm
2
in the
CGS system, and lb
f
/ft
2
in the U.S. customary system. The
unit  lb
f
/in
2
(psi)  is  also  common  in  the  U.S.  customary
system.
The pressure at the base of a vertical column offluid of density
ρand heighthis given by the expression
PP
o
ρgh(3.4-1)
whereP
o
is the pressure exerted on the top of the column andg
is the acceleration of gravity. This result gives rise to two ways
of  expressingfluid  pressure:  as  force  per  unit  area  (e.g.,
P14:7lb
f
/in
2
)  or  as  an  equivalentpressure head,P
h

P/ρg(e.g.,P
h
760 mm Hg), the height of a column of the
specifiedfluid with zero pressure at the top that would exert the
specified pressure at the bottom.
The earth’s atmosphere can be considered a column offluid
with zero pressure at the top. Thefluid pressure at the base of
this column isatmospheric pressureorbarometric pressure,
P
atm
. Although atmospheric pressure varies with altitude and
weather  conditions,  its  value  at  sea  level  is  always  close  to
1:0132510
5
N/m
2
(=14.696 lb
f
/in
2
=760 mm  Hg).  This
pressure value has been designated1 atmosphere. Other equiv-
alents to 1 atm in different units are given on the inside front
cover of this text.
Theabsolute pressureof afluid is the pressure relative  to a
perfect  vacuum  (P0).  Thegauge pressureis  the  pressure
relative  to  atmospheric  pressure:P
gauge
P
abs
P
atm
.  Com-
mon pressure gauges like a Bourdon gauge and an open-end
manometer  provide  a  direct  reading  of  gauge  pressure.  If
3.6  Summary67

atmospheric pressure is not known from a weather report or a
barometer reading, a value ofP
atm
1 atm is usually reason-
able to assume when converting between absolute and gauge
pressure.
Temperature scalesare obtained by assigning numerical values
to two experimentally reproducible temperatures. For example,
the Celsius scale is obtained by assigning a value of 0°C to the
freezing point of pure water at 1 atm and a value of 100°C to the
boiling point of pure water at 1 atm. A temperature of 40°Cis
consequently shorthand for“the temperature 40% of the way
from the freezing point of water at 1 atm to the boiling point of
water at 1 atm.”
The  four  most  common  temperature  scales  are  Celsius  (°C),
Fahrenheit (°F), and the absolute temperature scales Kelvin (K)
and  Rankine  (°R).  Temperatures  expressed  in  one  of  these
scales may be converted to equivalent temperatures in another
scale using Equations 3.5-1 through 3.5-4.
Temperatures should not be confused with temperature inter-
vals.  For  example,  a  temperature  of  10°C  is equivalent to a
temperature of 50°F (from Equation 3.5-4), but a temperature
interval  of  10°C  (e.g.,  the  interval  betweenT10°Cand
T20°C)  is  equivalent  to  a  temperature  interval  of  18°F
(the interval between 50°F and 68°F). An interval of 1 Celsius
degree or 1 kelvin is equivalent to 1.8 Fahrenheit or Rankine
degrees.
Note:This would be a good time
to work through thefirst interactive
tutorial.

Based on the stated coverage, how many cans of spray paint would it take to apply one coat to the
walls and ceiling of the tunnel?
(b)Having  just  heard  a  lecture  on  process  safety  in  your  engineering  class,  you  want  to  take

Besides composition information, the SDS contains information such as
physical  properties  (melting  point,  boiling  point,flash  point,  etc.),  other  threats  to  health  and
safety, recommended protective equipment, and recommended procedures for storage, disposal,
first aid, and spill handling. The SDS can typically be found online for most common substances.

pressure of escaping oil against a column offluid (the mud) having a density significantly higher than
those of seawater and oil. In the following problems, you may assume that seawater has a specific
gravity of 1.03 and that the subsea wellhead was 5053 ft below the surface of the Gulf.
(a)Estimate the gauge pressure (psig) in the Gulf at a depth of 5053 ft.
(b)Measurements indicate that the pressure inside the wellhead is 4400 psig. Suppose a pipe between
the surface of the Gulf and the wellhead isfilled with drilling mud and balances that pressure.
Estimate the specific gravity of the drilling mud.
(c)The drilling mud is a stable slurry of seawater and bariteSG4:37. What is the mass fraction of
barite in the slurry?
(d)What would you expect to happen if the barite weight fraction were significantly less than that
estimated in Part (c)? Explain your reasoning.

3.24.As described in Problem 3.16, adrilling mudis a slurry pumped into oil wells being drilled. The mud has
several functions: Itfloats rock cuttings to the top of the well where they can easily be removed; lubricates
and cools the drill bit; and keeps loose solids and water from leaking into the borehole. A drilling mud is
prepared by blending bariteSG4:37with seawaterSG1:03. The seawater has a dissolved salt
content of approximately 3.5 wt%. You have been asked to determine the specific gravity of the mud and
the wt% barite. You collect a sample of the mud from a blending tank on an oil platform and make the
following observations: (i) The mud appears homogeneous, even after standing for 2 days; (ii) the tare
mass of the calibrated vessel into which you pour the sample of mud is 118 g; (iii) the volume of the
collected sample is 100 mL, and the mass of the collection vessel and sample is 323 g; and (iv) the mass of
the vessel and residue remaining after completely evaporating water from the sample is 254 g.

3.26.Certain  solid  substances,  known  ashydratedcompounds,  have  well-defined  molecular  ratios  of
water to some other species. For example, calcium sulfate dihydrate (commonly known asgypsum,
CaSO

O), has 2 moles of water per mole of calcium sulfate; alternatively, it may be said that
1 mole of gypsum consists of 1 mole of calcium sulfate and 2 moles of water. The water in such
substances is calledwater of hydration. (More information about hydrated salts is given in Chapter 6.)
In  order  to  eliminate  the  discharge  of  sulfuric  acid  into  the  environment,  a  process  has  been
developed in which the acid is reacted with aragonite (CaCO
3
) to produce calcium sulfate. The calcium
sulfate then comes out of solution in a crystallizer to form aslurry(a suspension of solid particles in a
liquid) of solid gypsum particles suspended in an aqueous CaSO

solution. The slurryflows from
the crystallizer to afilter in which the particles are collected as afilter cake. Thefilter cake, which is

shift until Therèse Lagniappe, the reactor operator, let the run instruction sheet get too close to the
Coleman stove that was being used to heat water to prepare Lagniappe’s bihourly cup of Community
Coffee. What followed ended in a total loss of the run sheet, the coffee, and a substantial portion of the
novel Lagniappe was writing.
Remembering the less than enthusiastic reaction she got the last timeshe telephoned her supervisor in
the middle of the night, Lagniappe decided to rely on her memory of the requiredflow-rate settings. The two
liquids being fed to a stirred-tank reactor were circulostoic acid (CSA: MW75, SG0:90) andflubitol
(FB:  MW90,  SG0:75).  The  product  from  the  system  was  a  popular  over-the-counter  drug  that
simultaneously cures high blood pressure and clumsiness. The molar ratio of the two feed streams had to be
between 1.05 and 1.10 mol CSA/mol FB to keep the contents of the reactor from forming a solid plug. At the
time of the accident, theflow rate of CSA was 45.8 L/min. Lagniappe set theflow offlubitol to the value she

PART 2
Material Balances



CHAPTER
4
Fundamentals of
Material Balances
Certain restrictions imposed by nature must be taken into account when designing a new process
or analyzing an existing one. You cannot, for example, specify an input to a reactor of 1000 g of
lead and an output of 2000 g of lead or gold or anything else. Similarly, if you know that 1500 lb
m
of sulfur is contained in the coal burned each day in a power plant boiler, you do not have to
analyze the ash and stack gases to know that on average 1500 lb
m
of sulfur per day leaves the
furnace in one form or another.
The basis for both of these observations is thelaw of conservation of mass, which states
that mass can neither be created nor destroyed. (We will not be concerned in this book with the
almost infinitesimal conversions between mass and energy associated withchemical reactions
nor  with  the  conversion  of  mass  into  energy  associated  with  nuclear  reactions.)  Statements
basedonthelawofconservationofmasssuchas“total mass of inputtotal mass of output”or
“lb
m
 sulfur/day
in
lb
m
sulfur/day
out
”are examples ofmass balancesormaterial balances.
The design of a new process or analysis of an existing one is not complete until it is established
that the  inputs  and  outputs of  the entire process and of each individual unit satisfy balance
equations.
The  next  three  chapters  outline  procedures  for  writing  material  balances  on  individual
process  units  and  multiple-unit  processes.  This  chapter  presents  methods  for  organizing
known  information  about  process  variables,  setting  up  material  balance  equations,  and
solving  these  equations  for  unknown  variables.  In  Chapters  5  and  6  we  introduce  various
physical properties and laws that govern the behavior of process materials and indicate how
these  properties  and  laws  are  taken  into  account  (as  they  must  be)  in  formulating  material
balances.
4.0LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
Briefly  and  clearly  explain  in  your  own  words  the  meaning  of  the  following  terms:
(a)batch, semibatch, continuous, transient,andsteady-stateprocesses;  (b)recycle(and
its purposes); (c)purge(and its purpose); (d)degrees of freedom;(e)fractional conversion
of a limiting reactant; (f )percentage excessof a reactant; (g)yieldandselectivity;(h)dry-
basis compositionof a mixture containing water; and (i)theoretical airandpercent excess
airin  a  combustion  reaction.
Given  a  process  description,  (a)  draw  and  fully  label  aflowchart;  (b)  choose  a  convenient
basis of calculation; (c) for a multiple-unit process, identify the subsystems for which balances
might  be  written;  (d)  perform  the  degree-of-freedom  analysis  for  the  overall  system  and
each possible subsystem; (e) write the equations you would use to calculate specified process
variables; and (f) perform the calculations.You should be able to do these computations for
single-unit and multiple-unit processes and forprocesses involving recycle, bypass, or purge
streams.  If  the  system  involves  reactions,  you  should  be  able  to  use  molecular  species
balances,  atomic  species  balances,  or  extents  of  reaction  for  both  the  degree-of-freedom
analysis and the process calculations.
91

Given a combustion reactor and information about the fuel composition and feed rate, calculate
the feed rate of air from a given percent excess or vice versa. Given additional information
about the conversion of the fuel and the absence or presence of partially oxidized species such
as CO in the product gas, calculate theflow rate and composition of the product gas.
4.1PROCESS CLASSIFICATION
Chemical processes may be classified asbatch, continuous,orsemibatchand as eithersteady-
stateortransient. Before writing material balances for a process system, you must know into
which of these categories the process falls.
1.Batch process.The  feed  is charged (fed)  to a  vessel at  the beginning of  the process and
the  vessel  contents  are  removed  sometime  later.  No  mass  crosses  the  system  boundaries
between the time the feed is charged and the time the product is removed.Example:Add
reactants  to  a  tank  and  remove  the  productsand  unconsumed  reactants  sometime  later
when  the  system  has  come  to  equilibrium.  Neglect  any  reactions  that  occur  during
charging  and  discharging.
2.Continuous process.The inputs and outputsflow continuously throughout the duration of the
process.Example:Pump a mixture of liquids into a distillation column at a constant rate and
steadily withdraw product streams from the top and bottom of the column.
3.Semibatch process.Any process that is neither batch nor continuous.Examples:Allow the
contents  of  a  pressurized  gas  container  to  escape  to  the  atmosphere;  slowly  blend  several
liquids in a tank from which nothing is being withdrawn.
If the values of all the variables in a process (i.e., all temperatures, pressures, volumes,flow
rates) do not change with time, except possibly for minorfluctuations about constant mean values,
the process is said to be operating atsteady state. If any of the process variables change with time,
transientorunsteady-stateoperation  is  said  to  exist.  By  their  nature,  batch  and  semibatch
processes  are  unsteady-state  operations  (why?),  whereas  continuous  processes  may  be  either
steady-state or transient.
Batch  processing  is  commonly  used  when  relatively  small  quantities  of  a  product  are  to
be  produced,  while  continuous  processing  generally  is  better  suited  to  large  production  rates.
Continuous processes are usually run as close to steady state as possible; unsteady-state (transient)
conditions  exist  during  the  start-up  of  a  process  and  following  changes—intentional  or
otherwise—in process operation conditions.
Test Yourself
(Answers, p. 655)
Classify the following processes as batch, continuous, or semibatch, and transient or steady-
state.
1.A balloon isfilled with air at a steady rate of 2 g/min.
2.A bottle of milk is taken from the refrigerator and left on the kitchen table.
3.Water is boiled in an openflask.
4.Carbon monoxide and steam are fed into a tubular reactor at a steady rate and react to
form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Products and unused reactants are withdrawn at the
other end. The reactor contains air when the process is started up. The temperature of
the reactor is constant, and the composition andflow rate of the entering reactant stream
are also independent of time. Classify the process (a) initially and (b) after a long period
of time has elapsed.

4.2a The General Balance Equation
Suppose methane is a component of both the input and output streams of a continuous process
unit, and that in an effort to determine whether the unit is performing as designed, the massflow
rates of methane in both streams are measured and found to be different

There are several possible explanations for the observed difference between the measured
flow rates:
1.Methane is being consumed as a reactant or generated as a product within the unit.
2.Methane is accumulating in the unit—possibly adsorbing on the walls or other surfaces in the
vessel.
3.Methane is leaking from the unit.
4.The measurements are wrong.
If  the  measurements  are  correct  and  there  are  no  leaks,  the  other  possibilities—generation  or
consumption in a reaction and accumulation within the process unit—are all that can account for a
difference between the input and outputflow rates.
Abalanceon a conserved quantity (total mass, mass of a particular species, energy, momentum)
in a system (a single process unit, a collection of units, or an entire process) may be written in the
following general way:

4.2  Balances93

Two types of balances may be written:
1.Differential balancesindicate what is happening with a system at an instant in time. Each
term of the balance equation is arate(rate of input, rate of generation, etc.) and has units of the
balanced quantity unit divided by a time unit (people/yr, g SO
2
/s, barrels/day). This is the type
of balance usually applied to a continuous process. (See Example 4.2-1.)
2.Integral  balancesdescribe  what  happens  between  two  instants  of  time.  Each  term  of  the
equation is anamountof the balanced quantity and has the corresponding unit (people, g SO
2
,
barrels). This type of balance is usually applied to a batch process, with the two instants of time
being the moment after the input takes place and the moment before the product is withdrawn.
We are concerned in this text primarily with differential balances applied to continuous steady-
state systems and integral balances applied to batch and semibatch systems between their initial and
final states. In Chapter 10, we consider general balances on unsteady-state systems and show how
integral and differential balances are related—in fact, how each can be derived from the other.
The following rules may be used to simplify the material balance:
If the balanced quantity is total mass,set generation0and consumption0.  Except  in
nuclear reactions, mass can neither be created nor destroyed.
If the balanced substance is a nonreactive species (neither a reactant nor a product),
set generation0and consumption0.
If a system is at steady state,set accumulation0,regardless of what is being balanced.By
definition, in a steady-state system nothing can change with time, including the amount of the
balanced quantity.
4.2b  Balances on Continuous Steady-State Processes
For continuous processes at steady-state, the accumulation term in the general balance equation,
Equation 4.2-1, equals zero, and the equation simplifies to
inputgenerationoutputconsumption(4.2-2)
If the balance is on a nonreactive species or on total mass, the generation and consumption terms
equal zero and the equation reduces toinputoutput.
Example 4.2-2Material Balances on a Continuous Distillation Process
One thousand kilograms per hour of a mixture of benzene (B) and toluene (T) containing 50% benzene by
mass is separated by distillation into two fractions. The massflow rate of benzene in the top stream is 450 kg
B/h and that of toluene in the bottom stream is 475 kg T/h. The operation is at steady state. Write balances
on benzene and toluene to calculate  the unknown  componentflow rates  in the output streams.
SolutionThe process can be depicted schematically as follows:

Since the process is at steady state there can be no buildup of anything in the system, so the accumulation
term equals zero in all material balances. In addition, since no chemical reactions occur, there can be no
nonzero generation or consumption terms. For all balances, Equation 4.2-2 therefore takes the simple form
inputoutput.

Equating these two expressions for the accumulation yields
initial inputgenerationfinal outputconsumption(4.2-3)
This equation is identical to Equation 4.2-2 for continuous steady-state  processes, except that
in  this  case  the  input  and  output  terms  denote  the  initial  andfinal  amounts  of  the  balanced
substance rather thanflow rates of the balanced substance in continuous feed and product streams.
The words“initial”and“final”may be left out for brevity, as long as you don’t lose sight of what
“input”and“output”mean in the context of batch processes.
Example 4.2-3Balances on a Batch Mixing Process
Two methanol–water mixtures are contained in separateflasks. Thefirst mixture contains 40.0 wt% methanol,
and the second contains 70.0 wt% methanol. If 200 g of thefirst mixture is combined with 150 g of the second,
what are the mass and composition of the product?

4.2d  Integral Balances on Semibatch Processes
Integral balances can also be written for semibatch and continuous processes. The procedure is
to write a differential balance on the system and then to integrate it between two instants of time.
(A general discussion of the procedure is presented in Chapter 10.) In most cases the required
calculations are more complex than those we have seen so far; however, some problems of this
type are relatively straightforward, such as the one in the next example.
Example 4.2-4Integral Balance on a Semibatch Process
Air is bubbled through a tank of liquid hexane at a rate of 0.100 kmol/min. The gas stream leaving the tank
contains 10.0 mole% hexane vapor. Air may be considered insoluble in liquid hexane. Use an integral balance
to estimate the time required to vaporize 10:0m

total change in the moles of liquid hexane in the system during timet

, must be negative since hexane is
being  lost  from  the  system.  Since  the  total  number  of  moles  of  hexane  evaporated  occupied  a  liquid
volume  of  10.0 cubic meters  and (from  Table  B.1)  the  specific  gravity  of  liquid  hexane  is 0.659,  the

Balances are to be written for each of the quantities listed below for a continuous process. For
each  case,  state  the  conditions  under  which  the  balance  equation  takes  the  simple  form
“inputoutput.”(The solutions to thefirst two parts are given as illustrations.)
1.Total mass. (Steady state)
2.Mass of species A. (Steady state, A is nonreactive)
3.Total moles.
4.Moles of species A.
5.Volume. (The answer provides an indication of why volumes should be converted to
masses or moles before balances are written.)
CREATIVITY EXERCISE
Sulfur dioxide is contained in the feed and effluent streams of a chemical reactor, but it is neither
a reactant nor a product. The volumetricflow rates of both streams (L/min) are measured with
rotameters,  and  the  concentrations  of  SO
2
in  both  streams  (mol/L) are  determined  with  a  gas
chromatograph. The molarflow rate of SO
2
in the reactor effluent (determined as the product of
volumetricflow rate and concentration) is 20% lower than the molarflow rate of SO
2
in the feed.
Think of as many possible explanations for the discrepancy as you can.
4.3MATERIAL BALANCE CALCULATIONS
All material balance problems are variations on a single theme: given values of some input and
output stream variables, derive and solve equations for other variables. Solving the equations is
usually  a  matter  of  simple  algebra,  but  deriving  them  from  a  description  of  a  process  and  a

collection of process data may present considerable difficulties. It may not be obvious from the
problem statement just what is known and what is required, for example, and it is not uncommon
tofind students (particularly on tests) scratching their heads and staring vacantly for an hour at a
problem that should take ten minutes to solve.
In  this  section  we  outline  a  procedure  for  reducing  a  description  of a  process  to  a  set  of
equations that can be solved for unknown process variables. The approach to be outlined is not the
only way to attack material balance problems, but it always works and it keeps the time spent on
vacant staring and head scratching to a minimum.
4.3a  Flowcharts
In this book and in years to come, you will be confronted with prose of the following type.
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is carried out in a continuous packed-bed reactor.
One thousand pounds per hour of pure propane is preheated to a temperature of 670°C
before it passes into the reactor. The reactor effluent gas, which includes propane,
propylene, methane, and hydrogen, is cooled from 800°C to 110°C and fed to an absorption
tower, where the propane and propylene are dissolved in oil. The oil then goes to a stripping
tower in which it is heated, releasing the dissolved gases; these gases are recompressed and
sent to a distillation column in which the propane and propylene are separated. The propane
stream is recycled to join the feed to the reactor preheater. The product stream from the
distillation column contains 98% propylene, and the recycle stream is 97% propane. The
stripped oil is recycled to the absorption tower.
When you are given process information like this and asked to determine something about the
process, it  is essential to organize the  information in a way  that  is convenient  for  subsequent
analysis and calculations. The best way to do this is to draw aflowchartof the process, using
boxes or other symbols to represent process units (reactors, mixers, separation units, etc.) and lines
with arrows to represent inputs and outputs.

For  example,  suppose  a  gas  containing  N
2
and  O
2
is  combined  with  propane  in  a  batch
combustion chamber in which some (but not all) of the O

react to form CO

O,
and the product is then cooled, condensing the water. Theflowchart of this two-unit process might
appear as shown in Figure 4.3-1.
Used properly, theflowchart of a process can help get material balance calculations started
and keep them moving. To do so, the chart must be fullylabeledwhen it isfirst drawn, with values
of known process variables and symbols for unknown variables being written for each input and
output stream. Thereafter, the chart functions as a scoreboard for the problem solution: as each
unknown variable is determined its value isfilled in, so that the chart provides a continuous record
of where the solution stands and what must still be done.

In professionally drawnflowcharts, special symbols are used to denote different types of process units such as distillation
columns and heat exchangers. We will not generally use these symbols in this text, since our main purpose is to show you
how to perform material and energy balance calculations. Simple boxes are perfectly adequate to represent process units on
theflowcharts you draw for these calculations.

Several suggestions follow for labeling aflowchart to get the greatest possible benefit from it
in material balance calculations.
1.Write the values and units of all known stream variables at the locations of the streams on
the chart. For example, a stream containing 21 mole% O
2
and 79% N
2
at 320°C and 1.4 atm
flowing at a rate of 400 mol/h might be labeled
400 mol/h
0.21 mol O
2
/mol
0.79 mol N
2
/mol
T = 320°C, P = 1.4 atm
When you have done this for every stream on the chart, you have a summary of the known
information about the process, each item being conveniently associated with the part of the
process to which it relates.
The  stream  variables  of  primary  interest  in  material  balance  problems  are  those  that
indicate how much of each component is present in the stream (for a batch process) or theflow
rate of each component (for a continuous process). This information can be given in two ways:
as the total amount orflow rate of the stream and the fractions of each component, or directly as
the amount orflow rate of each component.

Once you have labeled a stream one way, it is easy to calculate the quantities that correspond to
the alternative way of labeling. (Verify this for the two examples just given.)
2.Assign  algebraic  symbols  to  unknown  stream  variables[such  as
_
m(kg  solution/min),
3
xlb
m
N
2
/lb
m
, andn(kmol C

)]and write these variable names and their associated units
on the chart. For example, if you did not know theflow rate of the stream described in thefirst
illustration of step 1, you might label the stream
n(mol/h)
T = 320°C, P = 1.4 atm
0.21 mol O
2
/mol
0.79 mol N
2
/mol
while if theflow rate were known and the mole fractions were not, the stream might be labeled
y(mol O
2
/mol)
T = 320°C, P = 1.4 atm
400 mol/h
(1 – y)(mol N
2

By convention we will show the units of labeled variables in parentheses and omit the parentheses for numerical values
(e.g., 2 kg/s).
4.3  Material Balance Calculations99

You may ultimately have to derive and solve an equation for each unknown that appears on
the chart, so it is to your advantage to keep the number of labeled unknowns to a minimum.
When labeling component mass or mole fractions of a stream, for example, variable names need
only be assigned to all but one fraction, since thelast one must be 1 minus the sum of the others.
If you are given that the mass of stream 1 is half that of stream 2, label the masses of these
streamsmand 2mrather thanm

If a volumetricflow rate of a stream is given, it is generally useful to label the mass or molar
flow  rate  of  this  stream  or  to  calculate  it  directly,  since  balances  are  not  normally  written  on
volumetric qualities.
Note on Notation:Although any symbol may be used to represent any variable,  having a
consistent notation can aid understanding. In this text, we will generally usemfor mass,
_
mfor
massflow rate,nfor moles,
_
nfor molarflow rate,Vfor volume, and
_
Vfor volumetricflow rate.
Also, we will usexfor component fractions (mass or mole) in liquid streams andyfor fractions in
gas streams.
Example 4.3-1Flowchart of an Air Humidification and Oxygenation Process
An experiment on the growth rate of certain organisms (e.g., yeasts, bacteria, or viruses) requires an en-
vironment of humid air enriched in oxygen. Three input streams are fed into an evaporation chamber to

be balanced.

type must be carried out using the methods of Section 3.3b.
Example 4.3-2Scale-up of a Separation Process Flowchart
In the conversion of biomass into ethanol, which can be used as a fuel or in the synthesis of other chemicals,
the  synthesized  ethanol  leaves  a  fermentation  reactor  in  an  aqueous  solution  containing  approximately
3.0 mole% ethanol with (for purposes of this illustration) the remainder water. One hundred gram-moles of
the mixture is fed to a distillation column in which it is separated into two streams: thedistillate, which
contains most of the ethanol (E) in the feed, and a reject stream containing mostly water (W). Aflowchart of
the process is shown here.

The same separation is desired for a process with a continuous production of 100.0 lb-moles/h of distillate.
After confirming that the balances on ethanol and water close, scale theflowchart accordingly.

Since  a  balanced  process  can  always  be  scaled,  material  balance  calculations  can  be
performed on the basis of any convenient set of stream amounts orflow rates and the results
can afterward be scaled to any desired extent. Abasis of calculationis an amount (mass or moles)
orflow rate (mass or molar) of one stream or stream component in a process. Often thefirst step in

4.3  Material Balance Calculations103

balancing a process is to choose a basis of calculation; all unknown variables are then determined
to be consistent with this basis.
If a stream amount orflow rate is given in a problem statement,it is usually most convenient
to use this quantity as a basis of calculation.If no stream amounts orflow rates are known,assume
one, preferably that of a stream with a known composition. If mass fractions are known, choose a
total mass or massflow rate of that stream (e.g., 100 kg or 100 kg/h) as a basis; if mole fractions
are known, choose a total number of moles or a molarflow rate.

104CHAPTER4Fundamentals of MaterialBalances

Material balances for this nonreactive process all have the simple form:flow rate inflow
rate out. Three possible balances can be written—on total mass, on naproxen sodium (A), and on
pseudoephedrine (B)—any two of which are independent and can be combined with the given
ratio of A to B to provide the equations needed to determine the unknowns. For example,

A logical question to ask at this point is how far can you go with this procedure? If the product
flow rate had also been unknown, for example, could another balance (on pseudoephedrine) have
been written to solve for it? Other points to consider are which balances to use when a choice exists
and the order in which these balances should be written.
The answers to these questions are not at all obvious when chemical reactions are involved in
the process, and we will temporarily postpone consideration of that subject. The following rules
apply to nonreactive processes.
1.The maximum number of independent equations that can be derived by writing balances on a
nonreactive system equals the number of chemical species in the input and output streams.
In the given example, two substances—sodium naproxen (A) and pseudoephedrine (B)—
make up the input and output streams of the process; you can write mass or mole balances on A
and B and a total mass or mole balance, but only two of these three equations are independent—
writing  the  third  accomplishes  nothing.  (If  you  wrote  all  three  equations  in  an  effort  to
determine three unknown variables, you would probably go through an elaborate algebraic
exercise to prove that 11 or something equally uninformative.)
2.Write balancesfirst that involve the fewest unknown variables.
In  the  example,  a  total  mass  balance  involves  only  one  unknown,
_
m,  while  A  and  B
balances each involve both
_
mandx. By writingfirst a total balance and then a A balance, we
were able to solvefirst one equation in one unknown, then a second equation, also in one
unknown.  If  we  had  instead  written  A  and  B  balances,  we  would  have  had  to  solve  two
simultaneous equations in two unknowns; the same answers would have been obtained, but
with greater effort if we are doing it manually. (If we are using software to solve the equations,
which two we choose makes no difference.)
Example 4.3-3Balances on a Mixing Unit
An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide contains 20.0% NaOH by mass. It is desired to produce an 8.0%
NaOH solution by diluting a stream of the 20% solution with a stream of pure water. Calculate the ratios (liters
H
2
O/kg feed solution) and (kg product solution/kg feed solution).
SolutionChoose a basis of calculation—an amount orflow rate of one of the feed or product streams—and then
draw and label theflowchart.
We will arbitrarily choose a basis of 100 kg of the 20% feed solution. (We could also have chosen a
flow rate of 100 lb
m
/min of the 8% product solution or 10 tons of diluent water. Thefinal results do not
depend on the basis chosen since we are only asked tofind ratios of stream amounts.) Theflowchart
appears as follows:

Count unknown variables and equations relating them.
If the number of unknowns equals the number of independent equations relating them, you will be able
to solve the problem; otherwise, either you have forgotten some relations or the problem is not well defined.
In the latter case, there is no point wasting your time by jumping into time-consuming calculations.
(a) Unknowns.Examining theflowchart, we see three unknown variables—m
1
,m
2
, andV
1
.
(b) Equations.For a nonreactive process that involves N species,up to N independent material balance
equations may be written. Since there are two species in our process (sodium hydroxide and water),
we can write two balances. We could write them on sodium hydroxide, water, total mass, atomic
sodium, atomic hydrogen, and so on; the point is that once we have written any two, we can obtain no
new information by writing a third one.
Since we may only write two material balances, we will need a third equation to solve for our
three unknowns (m
1
,m
2
, andV). Fortunately, we have one: the mass and volume of the diluent water,
m
1
andV
1
, are related by the density of liquid water, which we know. We thus have three equations in
three unknowns and therefore a solvable problem.

involve two unknowns (m

, and
the water density relationship involves two unknowns (m

4.3d  Degree-of-Freedom Analysis
Everyone  who  has  done  material  balance  calculations  has  had  the  frustrating  experience  of
spending a long time deriving and attempting to solve equations for unknown process variables,
only to discover that not enough information is available. Before you do any lengthy calculations,
you  can  use  a  properly  drawn  and  labeledflowchart  to  determine  whether  you  have  enough
information to solve a given problem. The procedure for doing so is referred to asdegree-of-
freedom analysis.
To perform a degree-of-freedom analysis, draw andcompletelylabel aflowchart, count the
unknown variables on the chart, then count theindependentequations relating them,
5
and subtract
the second number from thefirst. The result is the number ofdegrees of freedomof the process,
n
df
n
unknowns
n
indep eqns
. There are three possibilities:
1.Ifn
df
0, there arenindependent equations innunknowns and the problem can in principle
be solved.
2.Ifn
df
>0, there are more unknowns than independent equations relating them, and at least
n
df
additional variable values must be specified before all of the remaining variable values
can be determined. Either relations have been overlooked or the problem isunderspecified
and has infinitely many solutions; in either case, plunging into calculations is likely to be a
waste  of time.
6
3.Ifn
df
<0,  there  are  more  independent  equations  than  unknowns.  Either  theflowchart  is
incompletely labeled or the problem isoverspecifiedwith redundant and possibly inconsistent
5
Equations are independent if you cannot derive one by adding and subtracting combinations of the others. For example,
only two of the three equationsx3,y2, andxy5 are independent; any one of them can be obtained from the other
two by addition or subtraction.
6
When  a  proposed  process  has  a  positive  number  of  degrees  of  freedom,n
df
,  it  is  possible  to  perform  aprocess
optimization. The engineer choosesn
df
design variablesand assigns values to them, calculates values of the remaining
system variables from the system equations, and calculates the value of anobjective functionfrom the full set of system
variable values. The objective function may be a cost, a profit, or a rate of return on investment. The goal is tofind the set of
design variable values that yields the maximum or minimum value of the objective function.
4.3  Material Balance Calculations107

relations.  Again  there  is  little  point  wasting  time  trying  to  solve  it  until  the  equations  and
unknowns are brought into balance.
Sources of equations relating unknown process stream variables include the following:
1.Material balances. For a nonreactive process, no more thann
ms
independent material balances may
be written, wheren
ms
is the number of molecular species (e.g., CH
4
,O
2
) involved in the process. For
example, if benzene and toluene are the species in the streams entering and leaving a distillation
column, you could write balances on benzene, toluene, total mass, atomic carbon, atomic hydrogen,
and so on, but at most two of those balances would be independent. If additional balances are
written, they will not be independent of thefirst ones and so will provide no new information.
For a reactive process, the procedure becomes more complicated. We will defer further
discussion of this point to Section 4.7.
2.An energy balance(Chapters 7 through 9). If the amount of energy exchanged between the
system and its surroundings is specified or if it is one of the unknown process variables, an energy
balance provides a relationship between inlet and outlet materialflows and temperatures.
3.Process specifications. The problem statement may specify how several process variables are
related. For example, you may be told that of the acetone fed to a condenser [flow rate
_
m
1
(kg
acetone/s)], 40% appears in a condensate stream [flow rate
_
m
2
(kg acetone/s)]. A system
equation would then be
_
m
2
0:40
_
m
1
.
4.Physical properties and laws. Two of the unknown variables may be the mass and volume of
a stream material, in which case a tabulated specific gravity for liquids and solids or an equation
of  state  for  gases  (Chapter  5)  would  provide  an  equation  relating  the  variables.  In  other
instances,  saturation  or  equilibrium  conditions  for  one  or  more  of  the  process  streams
(Chapter 6) may provide needed relations.
5.Physical constraints. For example, if the mole fractions of the three components of a stream are
labeledx
A
,x
B
, andx
C
, then a relation among these variables isx
A
x
B
x
C
1. (If instead of
x
C
you label the last fraction 1x
A
x
B
, then you will have one less variable and one less
equation to worry about.)
6.Stoichiometric relations. If chemical reactions occur in a system, the stoichiometric equations
of the reactions (e.g., 2H
2
O
2
!2H
2
O) provide relationships between the quantities of the
reactants consumed and of the products generated. We will consider how to incorporate these
relationships into a degree-of-freedom analysis in Section 4.7.
Example 4.3-4Degree-of-Freedom Analysis
A stream of humid air enters a condenser in which 95% of the water vapor in the air is condensed. Theflow
rate of the condensate (the liquid leaving the condenser) is measured and found to be 225 L/h. Dry air may be
taken to contain 21 mole% oxygen, with the balance nitrogen. Calculate theflow rate of the gas stream leaving
the condenser and the mole fractions of oxygen, nitrogen, and water in this stream.

Wefirst do the degree-of-freedom analysis. There are six unknowns on the chart—
_
n
1
through

n
6
. We are
allowed up to three material balances—one for each species. We must thereforefind three additional relations
to  solve  for  all  unknowns.  One  is  the  relationship  between  the  volumetric  and  molarflow  rates  of  the
condensate: we can determine
_
n
3
from the given volumetricflow rate and the known specific gravity and
molecular  weight  of  liquid  water.  A  second  is  the  given  fact  that  95%  of  the  water  is  condensed.  This

However, no information in the problem statement provides a basis for establishing a sixth relation, so
there is one degree of freedom. The problem is therefore underspecified, and there is no point in attempting to
solve it. Without theflowchart, it would have been difficult to see this and a great deal of time would have
been wasted in a futile effort.
Suppose now that we had been given an additional piece of information—for example, that the entering
air contains 10.0 mole% water. Theflowchart would then appear as follows:

simultaneous pairs of equations, etc.) and circling the variables for which we would solve each equation
or set of simultaneous equations. In this problem, a solution procedure can be found that does not involve
simultaneous equations. (Verify that the units are correct in each equation.)

4.3e  General Procedure for Single-Unit Process Material Balance Calculations
The  problem-solving  approach  introduced  in  the  previous  sections  and  several  additional
procedural suggestions are summarized below. Given a description of a process, the values of
several process variables, and a list of quantities to be determined:
1.Choose as a basis of calculation an amount orflow rate of one of the process streams.
4.3  Material Balance Calculations109

If  an  amount  orflow  rate  of  a  stream  is  given  in  the  problem  statement,  it  is  usually
convenient to use it as the basis of calculation. Subsequently calculated quantities will then
be correctly scaled.
If  several  stream  amounts  orflow  rates  are  given,  always  use  them  collectively  as  the
basis.
If no stream amount orflow rate is specified in the problem statement, take as a basis an
arbitrary  amount  orflow  rate  of  a  stream  with  a  known  composition  (e.g.,  100 kg  or
100 kg/h if all mass fractions are known, or 100 mol or 100 mol/h if all mole fractions are
known).
2.Draw aflowchart andfill in all known variable values,including the basis of calculation.
Then label unknown stream variables on the chart.
Theflowchart is completely labeled if you can express the mass or massflow rate (or moles
or molarflow rate) of each component of each stream in terms of labeled quantities.Labeled
variables for each process stream should therefore includeeither
(a)the total mass [e.g.,m
1
(kg)] or massflow rate [
_
m
1
(kg/s)] and the mass fractions of all
stream components [e.g.,y
CH
4
(kg CH
4
/kg)],or
(b)the total moles [e.g.,n
1
(kmol)] or molarflow rate [
_
n
1
(kmol/s)] and the mole fractions of
all stream components [e.g.,y
CH
4
(kmol CH
4
/kmol)],or
(c)for each stream component, the mass [e.g.,m
H
2
(kg H
2
)], massflow rate [
_
m
H
2
(kg H
2
/s)],
moles [n
CO
(kmol CO)], or molarflow rate [
_
n
CO
(kmol CO/s)].
If  you  are  given  (or  you  can  easily  determine)  either  the  amount  orflow  rate  or  any  of
the component fractions for a stream, label the total stream quantity orflow rate and the
component  fractions  (categories  (a)  and  (b)  in  the  preceding  list).  If  you  only  know  the
species present but have no quantitative information, label component quantities orflow
rates (category (c) in the preceding list). Any labeling system will work for any stream, but
the algebra tends to be simpler if you follow these guidelines.
Try  to  incorporate  given  relationships  between  unknown  quantities  in  the  labeling.  For
example, if you know that the molarflow rate of Stream 2 is double that of Stream 1, label the
flow rates
_
n
1
and 2
_
n
1
rather than
_
n
1
and
_
n
2
.
Label volumetric quantities only if they are given in the problem statement or you are
asked to calculate them. You will write mass or mole balances, but not volume balances.
(Can  you  think  of  why  that  might  be?)
3.Express what the problem statement asks you to determine in terms of the labeled variables.
You will then know which unknowns you have to determine in order to solve the problem. We
will refer to the equations relating the unknown labeled variables on theflowchart as“system
equations”and these expressions as“additional equations.”
4.If you are given mixed mass and mole units for a stream(such as a total massflow rate and
component mole fractions or vice versa),convert all quantities to one basis or the other using
the methods of Section 3.3.
5.Do the degree-of-freedom analysis. Count unknowns and identify the system equations that
relate them. The equations may be any of the six types listed in Section 4.3d: material
balances, an energy balance, process specifications, physical property relationships and
laws,  physical  constraints,  and  stoichiometric  relations.  If  you  count  more  unknown
variables  than  equations  or  vice  versa,figure  out  what’s  wrong  (e.g.,  theflowchart  is
not completely labeled, or an additional relation exists that was not counted, or one or more
of your equations are not independent of the others, or the problem is underspecified or
overspecified). If the number of unknowns does not equal the number of equations, there is
110CHAPTER 4Fundamentals of Material Balances

no point wasting time trying to solve the problem. If there are zero degrees of freedom, go
to the next step.
6. (a)If the system equations are to be solved manually, write them in an efficient order
(minimizing simultaneous equations) and circle the variables for which you will solve
(as  in  Example  4.3-4).  Start  with  equations  that  only  involve  one  unknown  variable,
then pairs of simultaneous equations containing two unknown variables, and so on. Then
do the necessary algebra to solve the equations.
(b)If equation-solving software will be used, write the system equations in any order and
solve them.
7.Check your solution by substituting the calculated variable values into any balance
equations you did not use. For example, if you used only component balances when obtaining
the solution, substitute the variable values into the overall balance and make sure the left-hand
and right-hand sides are equal.
8.Solve the additional equations for quantities requested in the problem statement.
9.If a stream quantity n
g
orflow rate
_
n
g
was given in the problem statement and another value
n
c
(or
_
n
c
) was either chosen as a basis or calculated for this stream,scale the balanced process
by the ratio of the given value to the basis or calculated value to obtain thefinal result.
The following example illustrates this procedure.
Example 4.3-5Material Balances on a Distillation Column
A liquid mixture containing 45.0% benzene (B) and 55.0% toluene (T) by mass is fed to a distillation column.
A product stream leaving the top of the column (theoverhead product) contains 95.0 mole% B, and a bottom
product stream contains 8.0% of the benzene fed to the column (meaning that 92% of the benzene leaves with
the overhead product). The volumetricflow rate of the feed stream is 2000 L/h and the specific gravity of the
feed mixture is 0.872. Determine the massflow rate of the overhead product stream and the massflow rate and
composition (mass fractions) of the bottom product stream (a) solving the equations manually, and (b) using
an equation-solving program.
SolutionWe will explicitly illustrate the implementation of the steps of the procedure just outlined. Thefirstfive steps
of the procedure are the same regardless of whether the system equations are to be solved manually or with
equation-solving software.
1.Choose a basis.  Having  no reason  to do otherwise,  we choose  the given feed  streamflow rate
(2000 L/h) as the basis of calculation.
2.Draw and label theflowchart.

process variable and labeled as such on the chart. Its value will be determined from the known
volumetricflow rate and density of the feed stream.
Since mass balances will be written, the given component mole fractions in the overhead product
stream will have to be converted to mass fractions. The mass fractions are accordingly labeled as
unknowns.
We could have labeled the massflow rate and mass fractions of the bottom stream as we did
the overhead. However, since we have no information about either theflow rate or composition
of this stream, we have instead labeled the componentflow rates (following the guideline given
in Step 2 of the general procedure).
Every component massflow rate in every process stream can be expressed in terms of labeled
quantities and variables. (Verify this statement.) For example, theflow rates of toluene (kg T/h)
in the feed, overhead, and bottom streams are, respectively, 0:55_m

. The
flowchart is therefore labeled completely.
The 8%–92% benzene split between the product streams is not a streamflow rate or composition
variable;  nevertheless,  we  write  it  on  the  chart  to  remind  ourselves  that  it  isan  additional
relation  among  the  stream  variables  and  so  should  be  included  in  the  degree-of-freedom
analysis.

114CHAPTER 4Fundamentals of Material Balances

4.3f  In Textbooks, Balances Usually Close; In Real Chemical
Processes, Not So Much.
The procedure outlined in the preceding section will enable you to solve most of the problems
in Chapters 4–6 and (once you’ve learned about energy balances) in Chapters 7–9 as well. You
should be aware, however, that those problems were created based on three conditions that may be
unrealistic for real process systems: (1) just enough variables are known to allow calculation of
all unknown values; (2) given variable values (which in a real system would all have been measured
using instruments like those described in Chapter 3) are all accurately known; (3) material balances
on  all  species  always  close—that  is,  for  batch  and  steady-state  continuous  processes,  input
generation always equals outputconsumption, and if a species is nonreactive, input always equals
output. Real systems seldom function that neatly: in fact, if a balance ever closes exactly it is only
because of a coincidental cancellation of errors. In practice, unless the species is either exceptionally
valuable or exceptionally dangerous, a balance that comes close to closing is usually good enough.
Consider the following trivial system in which continuous streams of liquid ethanol and liquid
water are mixed, and you are asked to calculate the massflow rate of the mixture.

Now suppose a technician comes in and informs the process engineer (that would be you) that
the volumetricflow rate at the outlet was measured and converted to a massflow rate of 144 kg/s.
There is no longer anything to calculate, and your job is now to explain why the mass balance
on the system is not closing (148 kg/s in≠144 kg/s out).
Thefirst  question  to  consider  is  whether  the  difference  between  the  predicted  value  of
148 kg/s and the measured value of 144 kg/s (a difference of about 3%) is real or simply a result of
the fact that the measured variable values—the three volumetricflow rates—may allfluctuate.
If  you  take  repeated  measurements  using  the  threeflowmeters  and  calculate  the  standard
deviation  of the  results, straightforward analysis will  tell  you whether the  4 kg/s  difference is
statistically significant or if it falls in the range of normal measurement error. In the latter case,
you would carry out several more measurements to lower the margin of error. If the difference is
significant, however, then you are still faced with the need to explain the discrepancy.
Cover the table that follows, take a moment and think about possible explanations, and then
uncover the table and see how many you got and whether you thought of others not on the list.
Possible reasons for input≠output
Steady state had not been attained when the measurements were made.
Theflow measurements of any of the three streams could have been faulty due to either instrument or
human error.
The densities of thefluid streams could be different from those in Table B.1 (for example, because of
temperature variations), leading to errors in the conversion of volumetric to massflow rates.
There could be a slight leak in the tank.
4.3  Material Balance Calculations115

In more complex processes the list of possibilities may be considerably longer, including such
things as impurities in feed materials, temperature and pressurefluctuations, chemical reactions
among process species that have not been taken into account, unjustified assumptions of ideal
behavior, and so on.
In a number of chapter-end problems in this text, you will be asked to generate similar
lists  of  possible  reasons  for  discrepancies  between  what  you  calculate  and  what  would
actually be measured for a process, or reasons for failures of balances to close. You may not
see such textbook problems again for the remainder of your studies. You are almost certain
to  encounter  deviations  from  predictions  and  balances  that  don’t  close  in  your  laboratory
courses, however, and if you go to work in industry or academic research you are guaranteed
to  encounter  them  routinely.  We  hope  the  exercises  in  this  book  help  prepare  you  for
those  occasions.
4.4BALANCES ON MULTIPLE-UNIT PROCESSES
In the preceding sections, we referred rather loosely to“the system,”as in the statement“At steady
state the rate at which benzene enters the system equals the rate at which it leaves.”Not much was
said about what“the system”was. Up to now, however, not much needed to be said, since we have
considered only processes involving a single unit—a mixer, or a distillation column, or a reactor—
and that unit necessarily constituted the system.
Industrial chemical  processes  rarely involve just one process unit. One  or more chemical
reactors are often present, as are units for mixing reactants, blending products, heating and cooling
process  streams,  separating  products  from  each  other  and  from  unconsumed  reactants,  and
removing potentially hazardous pollutants from streams prior to discharging the streams to the
plant environment. Before we analyze such processes, we must take a closer look at what we mean
by a system.
In  general  terms,  a“system”is  any  portion  of  a  process  that  can  be  enclosed  within  a
hypothetical box (boundary). It may be the entire process, an interconnected combination of some
of the process units, a single unit, or a point at which two or more process streams come together or
one stream splits into branches. The inputs and outputs to a system are the process streams that
intersect the system boundary.
Aflowchart for a two-unit process is shown in Figure 4.4-1. Five boundaries drawn about
portions of the process define systems on which balances may be written.
Boundary
A
encloses the entire process; the system defined by this boundary has as inputs
Feed Streams 1, 2, and 3 and Product Streams 1, 2, and 3. (Convince yourself.) Balances on this
system are referred to asoverall balances. The stream that connects Units 1 and 2 is internal to
this system and so would not enter into overall system balances.

system and the streamflowing to Unit 1 is an output. Boundary

encloses Unit 1 (one input
stream and two output streams), Boundary
D
encloses a stream splitting point (one input stream
and two output streams), and Boundary
E
encloses Unit 2 (two input streams and one output
stream).
The procedure for material balance calculations on multiple-unit processes is nearly the
same as that outlined in Section 4.3. The difference is that with multiple-unit processes you may
have  to  isolate  and  write  balances  on  several  subsystems  of  the  process  to  obtain  enough
equations to determine all unknown stream variables. When analyzing multiple-unit processes,
carry out degree-of-freedom analyses on the overall process and on each subsystem, taking into
account only the streams that intersect the boundary of the system under consideration. Do not
begin  to  write  and  solve  equations  for  a  subsystem  until  you  have  verified  that  it  has  zero
degrees of freedom.
Example 4.4-1Two-Unit Process
A labeledflowchart of a continuous steady-state two-unit process is shown below. Each stream contains two
components, A and B, in different proportions. Three streams whoseflow rates and/or compositions are not

The situation becomes still more complicated when three or more process units are involved.
In such cases, balances may be written not only for the overall process and individual process
units, but also for combinations of units. Finding the right combinations can lead to a considerable
gain in computational efficiency.
Solvent extractionis used frequently to separate components of a liquid mixture (let’s call
them A and B) that are almost equally volatile, so they cannot be easily separated by methods such
as evaporation or distillation. Here is how it works. Mix the solution of A and B with a third
species, C, that has a strong affinity for B but is immiscible or nearly immiscible with A. Upon
settling, the combined mixture separates into two phases. One is rich in A and may contain small
amounts of B and C; the other is rich in C and contains most of the B in the original mixture and
possibly a small amount of A. The C-rich phase is then fed to another operation that separates B
and C, with B recovered as product and C recycled to the extractor.
Another common reason for choosing extraction is that Species A and/or B arethermally
labile:that  is,  they  may  react  or  degrade  when  exposed  to  high  temperatures,  such  as  those
normally  found  in  evaporation  and  distillation.  Such  systems  are  especially  common  among
complex  compounds  often  found  in  biological  or  pharmaceutical  processes.
7
The  following
example  illustrates  another  important  application  of  extraction  and  provides  an  example  of
formulating and solving multi-unit mass balances.
Example 4.4-2An Extraction–Distillation Process
A mixture containing 50.0 wt% acetone (A) and 50.0 wt% water (W) is to be separated into two streams—one
rich in acetone and the other in water. The separation process consists of extraction of the acetone from the
water into methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK or M), which has a much higher affinity for acetone than it does for
water. The process is shown schematically below.

4.4  Balances on Multiple-Unit Processes119

The acetone (solute)–water (diluent) mixture isfirst contacted with the MIBK (solvent) in a mixer that
provides good contact between the two liquid phases. A portion of the acetone in the feed transfers from
the aqueous (water) phase to the organic (MIBK) phase in this step. The mixture passes into a settling tank,
where the phases separate and are separately withdrawn. The phase rich in the diluent (water, in this process)
is referred to as theraffinate, and the phase rich in the solvent (MIBK) is theextract. The mixer–settler
combination is thefirststageof this separation process.
The raffinate passes to a second extraction stage where it is contacted with a second stream of pure
MIBK,  leading  to  the  transfer  of  more  acetone.  The  two  phases  are  allowed  to  separate  in  a  second
settler,  and  the  raffinate  from  this  stage  is  sent  to  a  waste-treatment  operation.  The  extracts  from  the
two mixer–settler stages are combined and fed to a distillation column. The overhead effluent is rich in
acetone and is the process product. The bottom effluent is rich in MIBK and in a real process would be
treated further and  recycled back to thefirst extraction stage,  but  we will not  consider recycle in this
example.
In a pilot–plant study, for every 100 kg of acetone–water fed to thefirst extraction stage, 100 kg of
MIBKisfedtothefirst stage and 75 kg is fed to the second stage. The extract from thefirst stage is
found  to  contain  27.5 wt%  acetone.  (All  percentages  in  the  remainder  of  this  paragraph  are  weight
percents.)  The  second-stage  raffinate  has  a  mass  of  43.1 kg  and  contains  5.3%  acetone,  1.6%  MIBK,
and 93.1% water, and the second-stage extract  contains  9.0% acetone,  88.0%  MIBK, and 3.0% water.
The overhead product from the distillation column contains 2.0% MIBK, 1.0% water, and the balance
acetone.
Taking  a  basis  of calculation  of  100 kg  acetone–water  feed, calculate  the  masses  and  compositions
(component weight percentages) of the Stage 1 raffinate and extract, the Stage 2 extract, the combined extract,
and the distillation overhead and bottoms products.
SolutionThis is a“trick”problem in that there is not enough information to calculate all of the requested quantities.
We will show how degree-of-freedom analysis allows a fairly quick determination of which variables can be
determined and how to determine them efficiently, and also helps avoid wasting a great deal of time trying to
solve a problem with insufficient information.
As always, we begin by drawing and labeling theflowchart. For simplicity, we will treat each mixer–
settler combination as a single“extractor”unit.

and  the  distillation  column  has  four.  (Verify  thesefigures.)  However,  the  system  composed  of  the  two
extraction units involves only three unknownsm
1
;x
M1
;m
3
and three balances relating them, hence zero
degrees of freedom. The solution procedure is as follows:

Analyzefirst (or second) extractor.Write acetone, MIBK, and water balances; solve to determine

At this point, we may quickly determine that we can go no farther. There are four remaining unknowns—
m
5
,m
A6
,m
M6
, andm
w6
. Whether we choose the overall process or the distillation column as our system, we
will only have three independent equations and hence one degree of freedom, and so we will be unable to
solve the problem. Moreover, since acetone, MIBK, and water all appear in both outlet streams, we cannot
solve for any one of the individual unknowns. (If there were no water in the overhead product from the
distillation column, for example, we could deduce thatm
W6

W4
). The problem is thus underspecified;
unless another piece of information is furnished, the amounts and compositions of the distillation column
products are indeterminate.
The calculations that can be performed are shown below. All balances have the forminputoutput
(why?), and every additive term of each balance has units of kilograms of the balanced species.

4.5RECYCLE AND BYPASS
It is rare that a chemical reaction A!B proceeds to completion in a reactor. No matter how little
A is present in the feed or how long the reaction mixture remains in the reactor, some A is normally
found in the product.
Unfortunately, you have to pay forallthe reactant fed to a process, not just the fraction that
reacts, and any A that leaves with the product therefore represents wasted resources. Suppose,
however, you couldfind a way to separate most or all of the unconsumed reactant from the product
stream. You could then sell the resulting relatively pure product andrecyclethe unconsumed
reactant back to the reactor. You would, of course, have to pay for the separation and recycle
equipment, but you would compensate for this cost by having to purchase less fresh reactant and
being able to sell the purified product at a higher price.
A labeledflowchart of a chemical process involving reaction, product separation, and recycle
is shown in Figure 4.5-1. Note the distinction between thefresh feedto the process and the feed to
the reactor, which is the sum of the fresh feed and recycle stream. If some of the stream variables

shown  in  Figure  4.5-1  were  unknown,  you  could  determine  them  by  writing  balances  on  the
overall process and about the reactor, separator, and mixing point.
Students frequently have difficulty when theyfirst encounter the concept of recycle because
theyfind it hard to understand that material can circulate in a system without an accumulation of
mass.  If  you  have  this  difficulty,  you  mightfind  it  helpful  to  refer  back  to  theflowchart  of
Figure 4.5-1. Observe that even though there is material circulating within the system, there is no
net accumulation: 110 kg of material enters the system each minute, and the same mass leaves
each minute. Within the system there is a net circulation rate of 120 kg/min, but the circulation has
no effect on the overall process material balance.
The next example illustrates two approaches to solving material balance problems on systems
with recycle. Thefirst one should be used if a manual solution is sought, and involves identifying
the overall  system and subsystems for which  balances may be written and using a degree-of-
freedom analysis to determine an efficient order in which to perform the analysis. The second
approach is to count unknown system variables, subtract the number of equations that can be
written for each subsystem (but not the overall system), and verify that there are zero degrees of
freedom. If there are, then write the subsystem equations and solve them with an equation-solving
program.
Example 4.5-1Material and Energy Balances on an Air Conditioner
Fresh air containing 4.00 mole% water vapor is to be cooled and dehumidified to a water content of
1.70 mole% H
2
O. A stream of fresh air is combined with a recycle stream of previously dehumidified air
and passed through the cooler. The blended stream entering the unit contains 2.30 mole% H
2
O. In the air
conditioner, some of the water in the feed stream iscondensed and removed as liquid. A fraction of the
dehumidified air leaving the cooler is recycled and the remainder is delivered to a room. Taking 100 mol
of dehumidified air delivered to the room as a basis of calculation, calculate the moles of fresh feed,
moles of water condensed, and moles of dehumidified air recycled (a) manually, and (b) using Excel’s
Solver.
SolutionThe labeledflowchart for this process, including the assumed basis of calculation, is shown below. Dashed
lines depict the four subsystems about which balances might be written—the overall process, the recycle–
fresh feed mixing point, the air conditioner, and the recycle–product gas splitting point. The quantities to be
determined aren

(a) Manual solution.Studentsfirst attempting recycle problems are tempted to jump in and start
writing balances immediately, and when they do theyfind themselves spending alongtime on the
problems, often failing to get solutions. If youfirst take a few minutes to go through a degree-of-
freedom  analysis  you  should  be  able  to  work  out  an  efficient  solution  method  before  doing
any  calculations,  ultimately  saving  yourself  muchmoretimethanittooktodotheanalysis.

Only one independent balance can be written for the splitting point because the streams entering
and leaving this subsystem are labeled as having identical compositions, so that the dry air/water
mixture in all three streams behaves like a single species. (Convince yourself: write a total mole
balance and a dry air or water balance around the splitting point and observe that you get the same
equation each time.)
At this point we could either write balances around the mixing point to determinen

therefore complete the solution.

There  are  several  reasons  for  using  recycle  in  a  chemical  process  besides  the  one  given
previously (recovering and reusing unconsumed reactants), including the following:
1.Recovery of catalyst.Many  reactors  use  catalysts  to  increase  the  rate  of  the  reaction.
Catalysts  are  usually  expensive,  and  the  processes  generally  include  provisions  for
recovering  them  from  the  product  stream  and  recycling  them  to  the  reactor.  They  may
be recovered with the  unconsumed  reactants or recovered separately  in special facilities
designed for this purpose.
2.Dilution of a process stream.Suppose a slurry (a suspension of solids in a liquid) is fed to a
filter. If the concentration of solids in the slurry is too high, the slurry is difficult to handle and
thefilter will not operate properly. Rather than diluting the feed with fresh liquid, a portion of
thefiltrate can be recycled to dilute the feed to the desired solids concentration.
3.Control of a process variable.Suppose a reaction releases an extremely large amount of heat,
making the reactor difficult and expensive to control. The rate of heat generation can be reduced
by lowering the reactant concentration, which can in turn be accomplished by recycling a portion
of the reactor effluent to the inlet. In addition to acting as a diluent for the reactants, the recycled
material also serves as a capacitance for the heat released: the greater the mass of the reaction
mixture, the lower the temperature to which that mass will be raised by afixed amount of heat.
4.Circulation of a workingfluid.The  most  common  example  of  this  application  is  the
refrigeration  cycle  used  in  household  refrigerators  and  air  conditioners.  In  these  devices,  a
single material is reused indefinitely, with only small makeup quantities occasionally being
added to the system to replenishfluid that may be lost through leaks.

component mass fractions. To confirm that the stream is fully labeled, we must verify that all componentflow

We will not go through the detailed solution but will simply summarize. The degree-of-freedom analysis
leads  to the  results  that  the  overall  system  has  one  degree  of  freedom,  the evaporator  has  zero,  and  the
crystallizer-filter has one. (Verify these statements.) The strategy is therefore to begin with the evaporator and
solve the balance equations for
_

With recycle it was 1470 kg/h, a dramatic difference. The massflow rate of thefiltrate is

2380 kg/h
Thefiltrate (which is discarded) contains 0:3642380866 kg/h of potassium chromate, more than the
filter cake contains. Recycling thefiltrate enables us to recover most of this salt. The obvious benefitof
recycling is the revenue from selling the additional potassium chromate. The costs include the purchase and
installation costs for the recycle piping and pump and the cost of power consumed by the pump. It would
probably not take long for the benefit to equal the cost, and thereafter the recycling would continue to increase
the process profitability.
A procedure that has several features in common with recycle isbypass, in which a fraction of
the feed to a process unit is diverted around the unit and combined with the output stream from the
unit. (For examples of processes that uses bypass, see Problems 4.43 and 4.44 at the end of this
chapter.) By varying the fraction of the feed that is bypassed, we can vary the composition and
properties of the product.

Bypass and recycle calculations are approached in exactly the same manner: theflowchart is
drawn and labeled, and overall balances and balances around the process unit or the stream mixing
point following the process unit are used to determine unknown variables.
4.6CHEMICAL REACTION STOICHIOMETRY
The occurrence of a chemical reaction in a process brings several complications into the material
balance procedures described in the previous sections. The stoichiometric equation of the reaction
imposes constraints on the relative amounts of reactants and products in the input and output
streams (if A!B, for example, you cannot start with 1 mol of pure A and end with 2 mol of B). In
addition, a material balance on a reactive substance does not have the simple form inputoutput,
but must include a generation and/or consumption term.
In  this  section  we  review  reaction  terminology  and  outline  procedures  for  carrying  out
material balance calculations on reactive systems.
4.6a Stoichiometry
Thestoichiometric equationof  a  chemical  reaction  is  a  statement  of  therelativenumber  of
molecules of reactants and products that participate in the reaction. For example, the stoichio-
metric equation for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide
2SO
2
O
2
!2SO
3
indicates that for every two molecules of SO
2
consumed, one molecule of O
2
is consumed and two
molecules  of  SO
3
are  produced.  Since  a  gram-mole  of  a  species  contains  afixed  number  of
4.6  Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry129

molecules6:0210
23
, the chemical equation also can be taken to mean two gram-moles of SO
2
react with one gram-mole of O
2
to produce two gram-moles of SO
3
. The numbers that precede the
symbols  for  each  species  are  thestoichiometric coefficientsof  the  species.  They  are  written
without units in stoichiometric equations, but when they are used in mass balances, they typically
take on units (mol, kmol, lb-mole, etc.) of the species with which they are associated.
A valid stoichiometric equation must bebalanced; that is, the number of atoms of each atomic
species must be the same on both sides of the equation, since atoms can neither be created nor
destroyed in chemical reactions (as opposed to nuclear reactions). The equation
SO
2
O
2
!SO
3
cannot be valid, for example, since it indicates that three atoms of atomic oxygen (O) are produced
for every four atoms that enter into the reaction, for a net loss of one atom, but

are balanced.
Thestoichiometric ratioof two molecular species participating in a reaction is the ratio of
their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced reaction equation. This ratio can be used as a
conversion factor to calculate the amount of a particular reactant (or product) that was consumed
(or produced), given a quantity of another reactant or product that participated in the reaction.
For the reaction
2SO

you can write the stoichiometric ratios
2 mol SO

1 mol O
2

;
2 lb-moles SO
2

2 lb-moles SO

and so on. If you know, for example, that 1600 kg/h of SO

is to be produced, you can calculate the
amount of oxygen required as
1600 kg SO

It is a good practice to include the terms“consumed”and“generated”when performing conversions
of this sort: simply writing 1 mol O

could be taken to mean that 2 mol of SO

4.6b Limiting and Excess Reactants, Fractional Conversion,
and Extent of Reaction
Two reactants, A and B, are said to be present instoichiometric proportionif the ratio (moles A
present)/(moles B present) equals the stoichiometric ratio obtained from the balanced reaction
equation. For the reactants in the reaction
2SO
2
O

to be present in stoichiometric proportion, there must be 2 moles of SO
2
for every mole of O
2
(so thatn

/n
O
2
2:1) present in the feed to the reactor.
If  reactants  are  fed  to  a  chemical  reactor  in  stoichiometric  proportion  and  the  reaction
proceeds to completion, all of the reactants are consumed. In the above reaction, for example, if
200 mol of SO
2
and 100 mol of O
2
are initially present and the reaction proceeds to completion, the
SO
2
and O
2
would disappear at the same instant. It follows that if you start with 100 mol of O
2
and
less than 200 mol of SO
2
(i.e., if the SO
2
is present in less than its stoichiometric proportion),
the SO
2
would disappearfirst, while if more than 200 mol of SO
2
is initially present the O
2
would
be completely consumedfirst.
The reactant that would be eliminatedfirst if a reaction proceeded to completion is called the
limiting reactant, and the other reactants are termedexcess reactants.A reactant is limiting if it is
present in less than its stoichiometric proportion relative to every other reactant. If all reactants
are present in stoichiometric proportion, then no reactant is limiting (or they all are, depending on
how you choose to look at it).

and suppose that 20.0 kmol/h of acetylene and 50.0 kmol/h of hydrogen are fed to a reactor. The

equation), and since the ratio of H
2
to C
2
H
2
in the feed is 2.5:1 (50:20), hydrogen is fed in a
greater-than-stoichiometric proportion to acetylene. Acetylene is therefore the limiting reactant.

4.6  Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry131

Chemical  reactions  do  not  take  place  instantaneously,  and  indeed  may  proceed  rather
slowly.  In  such  cases,  it  is  not  practical  to  design  a  reactor  for  complete  conversion  of  the
limiting reactant; instead, the reactor effluent emerges with some of the limiting reactant still
present and is then usually subjected to a separation process to remove the unconverted reactant
from the product. The separated reactant is then recycled to the reactor inlet. Thefractional
conversionof a reactant is the ratio
f
moles reacted
moles fed
(4.6-2)
The  fraction  unreacted  is  accordingly  1f.  If  100  moles  of  a  reactant  are  fed  and  90  moles
react,  the  fractional  conversion  is  0.90  (thepercentage conversionis  90%)  and  the  fraction
unreacted is 0.10. If 20 mol/min of a reactant is fed and the percentage conversion is 80%, then
(20 mol/min)0:8016 mol/min has reacted and (20 mol/min)10:804 mol/min remains
unreacted.
Considering  the  reaction  discussed  aboveC

,  suppose  20.0 kmol  of

Furthermore, suppose that after some time 30.0 kmol of hydrogen has reacted. How much of each
species will be present in the reactor at that moment?
Clearly,  if  you  start  with  50.0 kmol  of  H
2
and  30.0 kmol  reacts,  you  will  be  left  with
20:0 kmol H
2
. Also, if 30.0 kmol of H

reacts, 15.0 kmol of C

also reacts (Why?), leaving

We next define a variable called theextent of reaction, which—like fractional conversion—is
a  measure  of  how  far  a  reaction  has  proceededfrom  its  initial  state  (at  time  0  for  a  batch
reaction or at the inlet of a continuous reactor) to some later point (e.g., the endpoint of the
batch reaction or the product at the reactor outlet). Using the extent of reaction makes it easy to
keep track of the molar quantities orflow rates of reactants and products in feed and outlet
streams.  Although  the  explanation  we  are  about  to  give  may  seem  somewhat  complex,  the
method itself is simple.
To begin with, we defineν
i
(whereνis the Greek letter nu) to be thestoichiometric coefficient
of theith species in a chemical reaction. As part of the definition, we specify thatν
i
has units
of moles of Species i and is negative for reactants and positive for products.  For  example,
in    the    acetylene    hydrogenation    reaction    (C

stoichiometric reaction as A2B!C, so thatν

The extent of reaction is clearly dimensionless. Other key properties ofξare that it starts at

all species. Let’s see why. For the reaction we are considering, A2B!C, we get

The numerators of each of those four expressions represent the moles of each species (i,A,
B, C) involved in the reaction. When the reaction commences,n
i
n
i0
for every species, and
so  the  initial  value  ofξis  zero.  Thereafter,  the  numerators  must  be  negative  for  reactant
species (sincen
i
<n
i0
) and positive for products (sincen
i
>n
i0
). Sinceν
i
is also negative for
reactants  and  positive  for  products,  the  value  ofξmust  start  at  zero  and  increase  as  the
reaction  proceeds.
Finally,  the  quantities  of  species  that  react  are  proportional  to  their  stoichiometric  coef-
ficients. In the reaction A2B!C, for example, 2 moles of B react for every mole of A that
reacts and every mole of C that is formed. The three expressions forξon the right, which are
the  ratios  of  amounts  reacting  to  stoichiometric  coefficients  of  each  species,  must  therefore
have the same value, so thatξdoes not require the subscripti. The same result is obtained for any
batch reaction, and if dots are put above the symbolsnandν, for continuous steady-state reactors
as well. In short,

Suppose the feed to a continuous reactor consists of 100 mol/s of nitrogen, 300 mol/s of hydrogen,

A single chemical reaction A!2B takes place in a batch reactor, with known initial quantities
of A and B. Think of as many process variables as you can that might vary with the extent of
reaction;  then  suggest  means  by  which  each  of  these  variables  might  be  measured  in  an
experiment to determine the extent of reaction versus time. For example, the refractive index of
the reaction mixture might vary with the mixture composition; the experiment would then be to
pass a beam of light through the reaction vessel and measure the angle of refraction as a function
of time.

4.6c Chemical Equilibrium
Two of the fundamental questions of chemical reaction engineering are: Given a set of reactive
species  and  reaction  conditions,  (a)  what  will  be  the  equilibrium  composition  of  the  reaction
mixture, and (b) how long will the system take to reach a specified state short of equilibrium?
4.6  Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry135

Thefield ofchemical equilibrium thermodynamicsconcerns itself with thefirst question, and
chemical kineticsdeals with the second.
Some reactions are essentiallyirreversible: that is, the reaction proceeds only in a single
direction (from reactants to products) and the concentration of the limiting reactant eventually
approaches zero (although“eventually”could  mean seconds for  some reactions and years  for
others).  The  equilibrium  composition  for  such  a  reaction  is  therefore  the  composition  corre-
sponding to complete consumption of the limiting reactant.
Other reactions (or the same reactions at different conditions) arereversible: reactants form
products and products undergo the reverse reactions to reform the reactants. For example, consider
the reversible reaction in which ethylene is hydrolyzed to ethanol:
C
2
H
4
H
2
OC
2
H
5
OH
If you start with ethylene and water, the forward reaction occurs; then once ethanol is present,
the reverse reaction begins to take place. As the concentrations of C
2
H
4
and H
2
O decrease, the
rate of the forward reaction decreases, and as the C
2
H
5
OH concentration increases, the rate of
the reverse reaction increases. Eventually a point is reached at which the rates of the forward
and reverse reactions are equal. At this point nofurther composition change takes place, and the
reaction mixture is in chemical equilibrium.
A full discussion of the relations that can be used to determine equilibrium compositions
of reactive mixtures is beyond the scope of this text; however, at this point you have enough
knowledge  to  be  able  to  calculate  equilibrium  compositions  if  the  relations  are  given  to  you.
The next example illustrates such a calculation.
Example 4.6-2Calculation of an Equilibrium Composition
Numerous  chemical  processes  have  been  designed  to  produce  hydrocarbon  products  from  fossil  fuels
(coal, oil, natural gas). Thefirst step in such processes often involves conversion of the fossil fuel to a mixture
containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen, followed by thewater–gas shift reaction, which adjusts the ratio
of those species to a desired value:

, and the
reaction mixture comes to equilibrium at 1105 K. Calculate the equilibrium composition and the fractional
conversion of the limiting reactant.
SolutionThe  strategy  is  to  express  all  mole  fractions  in  terms  of  a  single  variable  (ξ
e
,  the  extent  of  reaction  at
equilibrium), substitute in the equilibrium relationship, solve forξ
e
, and back-substitute to calculate the mole
fractions and any other desired quantity.

4.6d Multiple Reactions, Yield, and Selectivity
In most chemical processes, reactants are brought together with the object of producing a desired
product in a single reaction. Unfortunately, reactants often can combine in more than one way, and
the product once formed may react to yield something less desirable. The result of these side
reactions is an economic loss: (a) less of the desired product is obtained for a given quantity of raw
materials, or a greater quantity of raw materials must be fed to the reactor to obtain a specified
product yield, and (b) steps necessary to obtain the product in specified form and purity become
more complicated.
For example, ethylene can be produced by the dehydrogenation of ethane:
C
2
H
6
!C
2
H
4
H
2
Once some hydrogen is produced, it can react with ethane to produce methane:
C

Moreover, ethylene can react with ethane to form propylene and methane:
C
2
H
4
C
2
H
6
!C
3
H
6
CH
4
Since the object of the process is to produce ethylene, only thefirst of these reactions may be
regarded as desirable; the second consumes the reactant without yielding the desired product and
the third consumes both the reactant and the desired product. In addition, instead of recovering
ethylene  from  a mixture  with  only  ethane and hydrogen, the  occurrences  of second  and third
reactions  mean  that  the  mixture  also  includes  methane  and  propane,  making  recovery  of  the
desired  product  more  complex  and  costly.  The  engineer  designing  the  reactor  and  specifying
operating conditions for it must consider not only how to maximize the production of the desired
product (C
2
H
4
), but also how to minimize the production of undesired by-products (CH
4
,C
3
H
6
).
The termsyieldandselectivityare used to describe the degree to which a desired reaction
predominates  over  competing  side  reactions.  Following  are  general  definitions  and  a  specific
4.6  Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry137

illustration using the dehydrogenation of ethane (see previous paragraph) as an example, where
ethylene (C

) is the desired product:

is  the  ratio  of  stoichiometric  coefficients.  As  defined  by
Equation 4.6-5, yield is a percentage, and fractional yield is determined simply by dividing by 100%.
If A is the desired product and B is an undesired product, one then refers to theselectivity of A
relativetoB. In the above example, the second calculated quantity is the selectivity of ethane relative
to methane. High values of yield and selectivity signify suppression of undesired side reactions
relative to the desired reaction.
Besides being defined by Equation 4.6-5, yield is also sometimes defined as moles of desired
product divided by either moles of reactant fed or moles of reactant consumed in the reactor. For
given feed and product compositions, the yields defined in these three manners may have completely
different values, so that when you see a reference to a yield it is important to be aware of the working
definition. Similarly, a common alternative definition of selectivity is moles of the limiting reactant
converted to the desired product divided by moles of the limiting reactant consumed×100%.
The  concept  of  extent  of  reaction  can  be  extended  to  multiple  reactions,  only  now  each
independent reaction has its own extent. If a set of reactions takes place in a batch or continuous
steady-state reactor andν
ij
is the stoichiometric coefficient of substanceiin reactionj(negative for
reactants, positive for products), we may then write

(4.6-7)
For a single reaction, this equation reduces to Equation 4.6-4.
As an example of how Equation 4.6-7 is applied, consider the pair of reactions in which
ethylene is oxidized either to ethylene oxide (desired) or to carbon dioxide (undesired):

One hundred kmol/min of ethane is fed to the reactor. The molarflow rate of H

. Of these, only thefirst has the simple forminputoutput: since the

either directly from the two atomic balances or by using the three
molecular species balances in conjunction with the stoichiometric equation for the reaction.
In  general,  systems  that  involve  chemical  reactions  may  be  analyzed  using  (a)  molecular
species balances (the approach always used for nonreactive systems), (b) atomic species balances,
and (c) extents of reaction. Each approach leads to the same results, but any one of them may be
more convenient for a given calculation so it’s a good idea to become comfortable with all three.
To  carry  out  degree-of-freedom  analyses  of  reactive  systems  you  mustfirst  understand
the concepts ofindependent equations,independent species, andindependent chemical reactions.
We explain these concepts in the next section, following which we outline and illustrate the three
approaches to reactive system balance calculations.
4.7b  Independent Equations, Independent Species,
and Independent Reactions
When wefirst described degree-of-freedom analysis in Section 4.3d, we said that the maximum
number  of  material  balances  you  can  write  for  a  nonreactive  process  equals  the  number  of
4.7  Balances on Reactive Processes141

independent speciesinvolved in the process. It is time to take a closer look at what that means and
to see how to extend the analysis to reactive processes.
The key concept is that ofindependent equations. Algebraic equations are independent if
you cannot obtain any one of them by adding and subtracting multiples of any of the others. For
example, the equations
1x2y4
23x6y12
are not independent, because231. In effect, they are really the same equation. (Convince
yourself by seeing what happens if you try to solve the two equations forxandy.) Similarly but
less obviously, the equations
1x2y4
22xz2
34yz6
are not independent, because3212. (Prove it.)
If two molecular species are in the same ratio to each other wherever they appear in a
process and this ratio is incorporated in theflowchart labeling,balances on those species
will not be independent equations.Similarly,if two atomic species occur in the same ratio
wherever they appear in a process,balances on those species will not be independent
equations.
For example, consider a process in which a stream of liquid carbon tetrachloride is vaporized
into a stream of air.

Since nitrogen and oxygen are shown as being in the same ratio wherever they appear on the

), you cannot count them as two independent species and so you
may count only two independent molecular species balances in a degree-of-freedom analysis—
one for either O
2
or N
2
and one for CCl
4
. (Try writing separate O
2
and N
2
balances and see what
you get.)
Similarly, atomic nitrogen(N) and atomic oxygen (O) are always in the same proportion
to each other in the process (again 3.76:1) as are atomic chlorine and atomic carbon (4 mol
Cl/1 mol  C).  Consequently,  even  though  four  atomic  species  are  involved  in  this  process,
you  may  count  only  two  independent  atomic  species  balances  in  the  degree-of-freedom
analysis—one  for  either  O  or  N  and  one  for  either  C  or  Cl.  (Again,  convince  yourself  that
the O and N balances yield the same equation, as do the C and Cl balances.)
Finally, when you are using either molecular species balances or extents of reaction to analyze
a reactive system, the degree-of-freedom analysis must account for the number of independent
chemical reactions among the species entering and leaving the system.Chemical reactions are
independent if the stoichiometric equation of any one of them cannot be obtained by adding and
subtracting multiples of the stoichiometric equations of the others.
For example, consider the reactions

However, any two of the reactions are independent. (They must be, since each one involves at least
one species that does not appear in the other one.)

4.7c  Molecular Species Balances
If  molecular  species  balances  are  used  to  determine  unknown  stream  variables  for  a  reactive
process,  the  balances  on  reactive  species  must  contain  generation  and/or  consumption  terms.
The degree-of-freedom analysis is as follows:
No:unknown labeled variables
No:independent chemical reactionsas defined in Section 4:7b
No:independent molecular species balancesas defined in Section 4:7b
No:other equations relating unknown variables
No:degrees of  freedom
Once a generation or consumption term has been calculated for a species in a given reaction, the
generation and consumption terms for all other species in that reaction may be determined directly
from the stoichiometric equation. (We will shortly illustrate this determination.) One generation or
consumption term must therefore either be specified or calculated for each independent reaction,
which is why each reaction adds a degree of freedom to the system.
We will use the dehydrogenation of ethane (Figure 4.7-1) to illustrate the required procedures.

4.7d  Atomic Species Balances
All balances on atomic species (C, H, O, etc.) take the form“inputoutput,”since atomic species
can neither be generated nor consumed in chemical reactions (as opposed to nuclear reactions).
The number of degrees of freedom is determined directly by subtracting equations from labeled
unknowns: no additional degrees of freedom are contributed by the reactions.

4.7e  Extent of Reaction
The third way to determine molar amounts (or unknown molarflow rates) for a reactive process is
to write expressions for each product species molar amount orflow rate in terms of extents of
reaction using Equation 4.6-4 (or Equation 4.6-7 for multiple reactions), substitute known feed
and productflow rates, and solve for the extents of reaction and the remaining reactive species
amounts orflow rates. The degree-of-freedom analysis follows:
No:unknown labeled variables
No:independent reactionsone unknown extent of  reaction for each

4.7  Balances on Reactive Processes145

Given  that  all  three  methods  of  carrying  out  material  balances  on  reactive  systems—
molecular species balances, atomic species balances, and extents of reaction—necessarily yield
the same results, the question is which one to use for a given reactive process. There are no hard
and fast rules but we suggest the following guidelines:
Atomic species balances generally lead to the most straightforward solution procedure,
especially when more than one reaction is involved.
Extents of reaction are convenient for chemical equilibrium problems and when equation-
solving software is to be used.
Molecular species balances require more complex calculations than either of the other two
approaches and should be used only for simple systems involving one reaction.
The next example illustrates all three approaches for a system involving two reactions.
Example 4.7-1Incomplete Combustion of Methane

monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. The reactions taking place are

Molecular Species Balances
As we mentioned before, this method is the most cumbersome when multiple reactions are involved and we
strongly recommend against using it. We present it here only for illustrative purposes (mainly to illustrate
why we recommend against using it).
Each balance on a reactive species will contain generation and/or consumption terms. We will use the
notationC
CH
4
;1
(mol CH
4
) to denote the consumption of methane in Reaction 1,G
H
2
O;2
(mol H
2
O) to denote
the generation of water in Reaction 2, and so on. Note that anyGandCterm for a specified reaction may
be expressed in terms of any otherGorCterm for the same reaction directly from the stoichiometric equation.
For example, the generation of water in Reaction 1 may be expressed in terms of the consumption of oxygen
in that reaction as
G

with those balances. Make sure you understand the form of each balance.

4.7f  Product Separation and Recycle
Two definitions of reactant conversion are used in the analysis of chemical reactors with product
separation and recycle of unconsumed reactants:
Overall Conversion:
reactant input to processreactant output from process
reactant input to process
(4.7-1)
Single-Pass Conversion:
reactant input to reactorreactant output from reactor
reactant input to reactor
(4.7-2)
As usual, the corresponding percentage conversions are obtained by multiplying these quantities
by 100%.
We will illustrate these two definitions with a process involvingisomerization, a chemical
reaction that rearranges the atoms in a molecule to form a second species with exactly the same
atomic composition. Anenzyme
8
(glucose isomerase) is used to catalyze

An enzyme is a protein that catalyzes a specific reaction. The name given the enzyme often is linked to the reaction
catalyzed—e.g., glucose isomerase catalyzes the isomerization of glucose.
9
Acatalystis a substance that alters the rate of a chemical reaction—possibly by many orders of magnitude—without itself
being consumed in the reaction. Reactant molecules interact with the catalyst to form an intermediate species, which then
further reacts to form the reaction product and regenerate the catalyst.

This example provides another illustration of the object of recycle. We have achieved complete
use of the reactant for which we are paying—the fresh feed—even though only 75% of the reactant
entering the reactor is consumed before emerging. The reason the overall conversion is 100% is that
perfect separation was assumed: any G that does not react gets sent back to the reactor. If a less-than-
perfect separation were achieved and some G left with the product stream, the overall conversion
would be less than 100%, although it would always be greater than the single-pass conversion.

atomic balances; for nonreactive subsystems (the recycle mixing point and the separation unit) we will count

Propane Balance About Mixing Point:
Consider what is happening in the process just analyzed. Only about 10% of the propane
entering  thereactoris  converted  to  propylene  in  a  single  pass;  however,  over  99%  of  the
unconsumed propane in the reactor effluent is recovered in the separation unit and recycled back to
the reactor, where it gets another chance to react. The net result is that 95% of the propane entering
theprocessis converted and 5% leaves with thefinal product.
In general, high overall conversions can be achieved in two ways: (a) design the reactor to
yield a high single-pass conversion, or (b) design the reactor to yield a low single-pass conversion
(e.g., 10%, as in the preceding example), and follow it with a separation unit to recover and recycle
unconsumed reactant. If the second scheme is used, the reactor must handle a larger throughput,
but it takes amuchlarger reaction volume to achieve a 95% conversion than a 10% conversion in a
single pass. The lower single-pass conversion consequently leads to a decrease in the cost of the
reactor. On the other hand, the savings may be offset by the cost of the separation process unit and
the pump, pipes, andfittings in the recycle line. Thefinal design would be based on a detailed
economic analysis of the alternatives.
4.7g  Purging
A problem may arise in processes that involve recycling. Suppose a material that enters with
the fresh feed or is produced in a reaction remains entirely in a recycle stream, rather than being
carried out in a process product. If nothing were done about this situation, the substance would
continuously enter the process and would have no way of leaving; it would therefore steadily
accumulate,  making  the  attainment  of  steady  state  impossible.  To  prevent  this  buildup,  a
portion of the recycle stream must be withdrawn as apurge streamto rid the process of the
substance  in  question.
4.7  Balances on Reactive Processes153

Theflowchart  shown  in  Figure  4.7-2  for  the  production  of  ethylene  oxide  from  ethylene
illustrates this situation. The reaction is 2C
2
H

O
2
!2C
2
H

O. A mixture of ethylene and air
constitutes the fresh feed to the process. The effluent from the reactor passes to an absorber where
it is contacted with a liquid solvent. Essentially all of the ethylene oxide is absorbed into the
solvent. The gas stream leaving the absorber, which contains nitrogen and unreacted ethylene and
oxygen, is recycled to the reactor.
If there were no nitrogen (or any other inert and insoluble substance) in the feed, there would
be no need for a purge stream. The recycle would contain only ethylene and oxygen; the fresh feed
would contain just enough of these substances to make up for the amount lost in the reaction, and
the system would be at steady state. However, there is nitrogen. It enters the system at a rate of
113 mol/s and must leave the system at the same rate in the purge stream. If the system were not
purged, nitrogen would accumulate at this rate until something—probably unpleasant—occurred
to shut down the process.
Material balance calculations on systems involving recycle and purge follow the procedures
given in previous sections. When labeling theflowchart, note that the purge stream and the recycle
stream before and after the purge takeoff all have the same composition.

recycled). Why would the process eventually shut down? What would you have to do to
get it to work?

FIGURE 4.7-2
Process with recycle
and purge.
Purge streams are essential
in chemical processes
involving recycle streams
that contain species in the
fresh feed that cannot be
separated from unconsumed
reactants. Determining how
to dispose of the purge
stream (for example, by
incinerating it) presents a
challenge, and the disposal
adds cost to the process.
Failure to plan for such
streams can, however,
create severe process and
environmental problems.

Example 4.7-3Recycle and Purge in the Synthesis of Methanol
Methanol (also known as methyl alcohol and wood alcohol) is used as a raw material in the manufacture of
formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), and a number of other important chemicals. It
also has many other uses, including as a solvent, a disinfectant, and a clean-burning fuel. One of the ways
it can be synthesized is by reacting carbon dioxide and hydrogen:

The fresh feed to a methanol synthesis process contains hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and 0.400 mole%
inerts (I). The reactor effluent passes to a condenser that removes essentially all of the methanol and water
formed and none of the reactants or inerts. The latter substances are recycled to the reactor. To avoid buildup
of the inerts in the system, a purge stream is withdrawn from the recycle.
The feed to thereactor(not the fresh feed to the process) contains 28.0 mole% CO

, 70.0 mole% H
2
, and
2.00 mole%  inerts.  The  single-pass  conversion  of  hydrogen  is  60.0%.  Calculate  the  molarflow  rates
and molar compositions of the fresh feed, the total feed to the reactor, the recycle stream, and the purge
stream for a methanol production rate of 155 kmol CH

(a)Choose a basis of calculation of 100 mol of the feed to the reactor (a convenient basis since you
know the composition of this stream), and draw and label aflowchart.
(b)Perform  a  degree-of-freedom  analysis  for  the  system.  As  a  suggested  sequence,  determine  the
difference between the number of equations and number of variables for each of the following:
overall  system,  recycle-fresh  feed  mixing  point,  reactor,  condenser,  and  recycle-purge  splitting
point. Verify that there are zero degrees of freedom for the entire process and identify an efficient
procedure for carrying out the calculations (including scaling up the calculated process variables to
the desired methanol production rate).

In 1972, essentially all of the 6 billion aluminum beverage cans sold in the
United States were discarded; that is, none were recycled.
11
By 2010, the recycling rate had increased to
58.1%, and advances in technology during that period increased the number of cans produced with 1 lb

of
aluminum from 21.75 in 1972 to 33 in 2010.

4.8COMBUSTION REACTIONS
Combustionis the rapid reaction of a substance with oxygen. Oxidation reactions of carbon to
CO and CO
2
, hydrogen to H
2
O, sulfur to SO
2
, and nitrogen to NO and NO
2
release significant
quantities of energy as heat. The most important of the combustion reactions are those in which
fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, and natural gas—are burned to release energy that ultimately shows
up  as  electricity,  commercial  and  home  heating,  and  vehicular  motion.  Because  common
combustion  products  such  as  those  listed  above  are  released  to  the  atmosphere  in  such  huge
quantities, considerable effort must be made to monitor and control their emission rates. Analysis
of combustion reactions and reactors and the abatement and control of environmental pollution
caused by combustion products are problems with which chemical engineers are heavily involved.
In  the  sections  that  follow,  we  introduce  terminology  commonly  used  in  the  analysis  of
combustion reactors and discuss material balance calculations for such reactors. Chapter 9 outlines
methods of determining the energy obtainable from combustion reactions.
4.8a Combustion Chemistry
Most of the fuel used in power-plant combustion furnaces is either coal (carbon, some hydrogen
and  sulfur,  and  various  noncombustible  materials),  fuel  oil  (mostly  high  molecular  weight
hydrocarbons, with varying small amounts of sulfur), gaseous fuel (such asnatural gas, which
is primarily methane), orliquefied petroleum gas, which is usually propane and/or butane.
When a fuel is burned, carbon in the fuel reacts to form either CO
2
or CO, hydrogen forms H
2
O,
and sulfur forms SO
2
. At temperatures greater than approximately 1800°C, some of the nitrogen in
the air reacts to form nitric oxide (NO). A combustion reaction in which CO is formed is referred to as
partial combustionorincomplete combustion, even though CO
2
may also be produced.

The  termcomposition on a wet basisis commonly used  to denote  the  component  mole
fractions of a gas that contains water, andcomposition on a dry basissignifies the component
mole fractions of the same gas without the water. For example, a gas that contains 33.3 mole%

O (wet basis) contains 50% CO

The product gas that leaves a combustion furnace is referred to as thestack gasorflue gas.
When theflow rate of a gas in a stack is measured, it is the totalflow rate of the gas including
water; on the other hand, many common techniques for analyzing stack gases provide composi-
tions on a dry basis. You must therefore be able to convert a composition on a dry basis to its
corresponding composition on a wet basis before writing material balances on the combustion
reactor. The procedure to convert a composition from one basis to another is similar to the one
used to convert mass fractions to mole fractions and vice versa given in Chapter 3: assume an
amount of the stack  gas (e.g., 100 mol of wet gas if  composition on a wet basis  is known or
100 mol of dry gas if a dry-basis composition is known), calculate how much of each component is
present, and use this information to calculate mole fractions on the desired basis.

4.8b Theoretical and Excess Oxygen and Air
If two reactants participate in a reaction and one is considerably more expensive than the other,
the usual practice is to feed the less expensive reactant in excess of the valuable one. Doing so has
the effect of increasing the conversion of the valuable reactant at the expense of the cost of the
excess reactant and additional pumping costs.
The  extreme  case  of  an  inexpensive  reactant  is  air,  which  is  virtually  free.  Combustion
reactions  are  therefore  invariably  run  with  more  air  than  is  needed  to  supply  oxygen  in
stoichiometric proportion to the fuel. The following terms are commonly used to describe the
quantities of fuel and air fed to a reactor.
Theoretical Oxygen:The moles (batch) or molarflow rate (continuous) of O
2
needed for complete
combustion of all the fuel fed to the reactor, assuming that all carbon in the fuel is oxidized to
CO
2
, all the hydrogen is oxidized to H
2
O, and all the sulfur is converted to SO
2
.
Theoretical Air:The quantity of air that contains the theoretical oxygen.
Excess Air:The amount by which the air fed to the reactor exceeds the theoretical air.
Percent Excess Air:

100%(4.8-1)
If you know the fuel feed rate and the stoichiometric equation(s) for complete combustion of the fuel,
you can calculate the theoretical O
2
and air feed rates. If in addition you know the actual feed rate of
air, you can calculate the percent excess air from Equation 4.8-1. It is also easy to calculate the air
feed rate from the theoretical air and a given value of the percentage excess: if 50% excess air is
supplied, for example, then

Two points of confusion often arise in the calculation of theoretical and excess air, both of
which are caused by ignoring the definitions of these terms.
1.The theoretical air required to burn a given quantity of fuel does not depend on how much
is actually burned. The fuel may not react completely, and it may react to form both CO and
CO
2
, but the theoretical air is still that which would be required to react withallof the fuel to
form CO
2
only.
2.The value of the percent excess air depends only on the theoretical air and the air feed rate,
and not on how much O
2
is consumed in the reactor or whether combustion is complete
or partial.

CREATIVITY EXERCISES
1.Years ago it was common to operate boiler furnaces with air fed in 20% excess or more, while
today improved boiler designs enable the use of 5–10% excess air. Cite as many possible negative
consequences as you can think of for the air-to-fuel feed ratio being (a) too low and (b) too high.
2.The costs of petroleum and natural gas have increased dramatically since the early 1970s, and
there is some question about their continued long-term availability. List as many alternative
energy sources as you can think of, being as creative as you can, and then go back and suggest
possible drawbacks to each one.
4.8c Material Balances on Combustion Reactors
The procedure for writing and solving material balances for a combustion reactor is the same as
that for any other reactive system. Bear these points in mind, however:
1.When  you  draw  and  label  theflowchart,  be  sure  the  outlet  stream  (the  stack  gas)  includes
(a) unreacted fuel unless you are told that all the fuel is consumed, (b) unreacted oxygen, (c)
water and carbon dioxide, as well as carbon monoxide if the problem statement says any is
present, and (d) nitrogen if the fuel is burned with air and not pure oxygen.
2.To calculate the oxygen feed rate from a specified percent excess oxygen or percent excess air
(both percentages have the same value, so it doesn’t matter which one is stated),first calculate
the  theoretical  O
2
from  the  fuel  feed  rate  and  the  reaction  stoichiometry  for  complete
combustion,  then  calculate  the  oxygen  feed  rate  by  multiplying  the  theoretical  oxygen  by
1fractional excess oxygen.
3.If only one reaction is involved, all three balance methods (molecular species balances, atomic
species  balances,  extent  of  reaction)  are  equally  convenient.  If  several  reactions  occur
simultaneously, however—such as combustion of a fuel to form both CO and CO
2
—molecular
species balances should generally be avoided.
Example 4.8-3Combustion of Ethane
Ethane is burned with 50% excess air. The percentage conversion of the ethane is 90%; of the ethane burned,
25% reacts to form CO and the balance reacts to form CO
2
. Calculate the molar composition of the stack gas
on a dry basis and the mole ratio of water to dry stack gas.

If a fuel of unknown composition is burned, you may be able to deduce something about its
composition  by  analyzing  the  combustion  products  and  writing  and  solving  atomic  species
balances. The procedure is illustrated in the next example.
4.8  Combustion Reactions167

Example 4.8-4Combustion of a Hydrocarbon Fuel of Unknown Composition
A hydrocarbon gas is burned with air. The dry-basis product gas composition is 1.5 mole% CO, 6.0%
CO
2
,8.2%O
2
, and 84.3% N
2
. There is no atomic oxygen in the fuel. Calculate the ratio of hydrogen to
carbon in the fuel gas and speculate on what the fuel might be. Then calculate the percent excess air fed
to the reactor.
SolutionBasis: 100 mol Product Gas
Since the molecular composition of the fuel is unknown, we label its atomic species composition. We also
recognize that since the fuel is a hydrocarbon, water must be one of the combustion products.

4.9SOME ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT
CHEMICAL PROCESSES
The methods  we present in this chapter  and the rest of the text are applied universally in the
chemical process industry. There are several features of industrial processes that tend not to show
up in textbooks, however. You willfind out about them as soon as you go to work as a chemical
engineer, but it could be helpful to know about them in advance.
Textbook processes always work the way they are designed to work. In practice, unexpected
occurrences are common, especially when processes arefirst run.
Textbook process variables are measured with relatively high precision. In practice, measure-
ments with varying degrees of accuracy and precision can introduce errors.
The  invisible  people  who  run  textbook  processes  never  do  anything  wrong.  Real  process
operators and managers, being human, sometimes make mistakes.
In textbooks you always have exactly the data you need to determine what you want to know,
no matter how complex the problem may be. In practice, you may not have all the data you
need, and you may have to either get the missing data yourself or use approximations and make
assumptions based on experience.
In textbooks, theclosureof every steady-state material balance [defined as (output/input)×
100%] is 100%. In practice, measurement imprecision and inaccurate assumptions may lead to
closures  that  differ—possibly  significantly—from  100%.  Also,  in  practice  there  is  no  such
thing as true steady state: variable valuesalwaysfluctuate or drift to some extent.
Textbook problems usually have one and only one correct answer, and your job is to follow
prescribed procedures to determine it. In practice you may have trouble even defining what the
real problem is, and once you have defined it you can usuallyfind a variety of solutions, each of
which  has  advantages  and  disadvantages.  Making  the  choice  involves  considerations  of
technological capability, short-range profit, long-range profit, safety, environmental protection,
and ethics. Textbooks provide little help with this type of problem.
Since our purpose in this text is to help you to develop skills in certain basic methods of
chemical process analysis, we have intentionally omitted most of the complicating factors that can
4.9  Some Additional Considerations about Chemical Processes169

make industrial processes so difficult to manage. Once you have mastered the basics, you can start
learning how to adjust for the complications.
Example 4.9-1Material Balances in Process Design and Process Operation
Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is used extensively as a solvent in a wide range of applications. For example, it is
a key ingredient in the dry-erase markers used in many classrooms. When used as a solvent in industrial
processes, there are both economic and environmental incentives for its recovery and reuse. In one such
process, MEK is to be recovered from a gas mixture containing 20.0 mole% MEK and 80.0 mole% N
2
at 85°C
and 3.5 atm. A stream of this mixture is fed to a condenser at a rate of 500 L/s and cooled at constant pressure,
causing most of the MEK to condense.

rate, and molarflow rate of a gas (Chapter 5); (b) specifies a condenser temperature of 15°C; (c) calculates the
mole fraction of MEK in the vapor product usingRaoult’s law—an approximate relationship between the
compositions  of  liquid  and  vapor  phases  in  equilibrium  with  each  other  at  a  specified  temperature  and
pressure (Chapter 6); and (d) calculates the molarflow rates of the vapor and liquid products from nitrogen
and MEK balancesinputoutput. The results follow.

A condenser is then installed and run at the design temperature and pressure. The volumetricflow rates
of the feed stream and the vapor and liquid product streams are measured with rotameters, and the MEK mole
fractions in the feed and vapor effluent streams are measured with a gas chromatograph. The feed streamflow
rate is set to 500 L/s and enough time is allowed to pass for the product stream rotameter readings to reach
steady levels. The feed and product gasflow rates are then converted to molarflow rates using the ideal-gas
equation of state, and the product liquidflow rate is converted to a molarflow rate using a tabulated MEK
density and the molecular weight of MEK. Here are the results.

2. Possible reasons for differences between design values and experimental values.
Human errors, instrument errors, and random data scatter.Plant  or  laboratory  personnel  are
responsible  for  setting  and  maintaining  the  process  operating  conditions,  reading  the  feed  and
product streamflowmeters, and drawing samples of the product gas and analyzing them. Any error
that any  of these individuals  makes could lead to errors in measured  variable values and values
calculated from them. Moreover, any measured value (e.g., an input or output stream volumetricflow
rate,  the  mole  fraction  of  MEK  in  the  feed  or  vapor  product  stream,  any  stream  temperature  or
pressure) is subject to errors due to a faulty instrument (e.g., a malfunctioning or poorly calibrated
flowmeter or gas chromatograph) or random data scatter.
Impurities in the feed.The design calculations were based on an assumption that the feed contains
only MEK vapor and nitrogen. Impurities present in the feed could react with the MEK, or they could
condense and affect the vapor–liquid equilibrium distribution of MEK in the products.
Incorrect assumption of steady state.Closure should be expected only after the system reaches
steady state, so that inputoutput. In the experimental run, steady state was declared when the
operator  could  no  longer  see  changes  in  the  outlet  stream  rotameter  readings.  It  is  possible  that
theflow rates were still changing but the rotameter was not sensitive enough to show the changes. It is
also possible that MEK was still accumulating in the system—for example, by adsorbing on the
container walls—and much more time would be required for the buildup to be complete.
Incorrect assumption that MEK is not reactive.If  MEK  undergoes  a  reaction  in  the  system—
decomposition,    for    example,    or    reaction    with    something    on    the    reactor    wall—then
inputoutputconsumption. The output would then necessarily be less  than the input and the
balance would not close.
Errors due to approximations in the experimental data analysis.Several  potential  errors  were
introduced when the measured volumetricflow rates were converted to molarflow rates. Volumetric
gasflow rates were converted using the ideal-gas equation of state, which is approximate, and the
volumetric liquidflow rate was converted using a tabulated density that may not have been measured
at the system temperature. Also, the fact that a physical property value has been published is no
guarantee that it is correct.
Approximations in the design analysis.Like  the  ideal-gas  equation  of state,  Raoult’s  law  is  an
approximation that may be excellent or seriously in error, depending on the experimental process
conditions.
4.9  Some Additional Considerations about Chemical Processes171

There are other possibilities, but you get the idea. The point is that no matter how carefully you design a
process, you cannot predict exactly what the real process will do. Approximations and assumptions must be
made for every process design; closures on real process material balances are never exactly 100%; nothing
can be measured with complete accuracy; and everyone sometimes makes mistakes.
Experienced design engineers know these things and account for them withoverdesign factors. If they
calculate that they need a 2500-liter reactor, they might order a 3000-liter or 3500-liter reactor to make sure
they  have  enough  reactor  capacity  to  meet  both  current  and  anticipated  product  demands.  The  more
uncertainties in the design or the projected product demand, the greater the overdesign. A large part of what
engineers  do involves reducing  the uncertainties  and thus lowering  the required  overdesign,  resulting  in
major reductions in equipment purchase and maintenance costs.
4.10  SUMMARY
Every  chemical  process  analysis  involves  writing  and  solving
material balances to account for all process species in feed and
product streams. This chapter outlines and illustrates a systematic
approach  to  material  balance  calculations.  The  procedure  is  to
draw and label aflowchart, perform a degree-of-freedom analysis
to  verify  that  enough  equations  can  be  written  to  solve  for  all
unknown process variables, and write and solve the equations.
The general balance equationis
inputgenerationoutputconsumptionaccumulation
Adifferential balanceapplies  to  an  instant  of  time  and
each  term  is  a  rate  (mass/time  or  moles/time).  Anintegral
balanceapplies to a time interval and each term is an amount
(mass or moles). Balances may be applied to total mass, indi-
vidual species, or energy. (They may also be applied to momen-
tum, but we will not consider momentum balances in this text.)
For  a  differential  balance  on  a  continuous  process  (material
flows  in  and  out  throughout  the  process)  at  steady-state  (no
process variables change with time), the accumulation term in the
balance (the rate of buildup or depletion of the balanced species)
equals  zero.  For  an  integral  balance  on  a  batch  process  (no
materialflows in or out during the process), the input and output
terms equal zero and accumulationinitial inputfinal output.
In both cases, the balance simplifies to
inputgenerationoutputconsumption
If the balance is on total mass or on a nonreactive species, the
equation simplifies further to
inputoutput
A process stream on aflowchart iscompletely labeledif values
or variable names are assigned to one of the following sets of
stream  variables:  (a)  total  massflow  rate  or  total  mass  and
component mass fractions; (b) massflow rates or masses of each
stream component; (c) total molarflow rate or total moles and
component mole fractions; and (d) molarflow rates or moles of
each stream component.If a total amount orflow rate or one or
more component fractions are known for a stream,use(a)or
(c)to incorporate the known values into the labeling.If neither
the total nor any fractions are known,using(b)or
(d)(comp
o-
nent amo
unts orflow rates)often leads to easier algebra.
Volumetric quantities should be labeled only if they are either
given  or  requested  in  the  problem  statement.  Aflowchart  is
completely labeled if every stream is completely labeled.
Abasis of calculationfor a process is an amount orflow rate of
one of the process streams. If two or more streamflow rates or
amounts are given in the problem statement, they constitute the
basis of calculation. If one is given, it may be assumed as a
basis but it may also be convenient to assume another basis and
then scale theflowchart to the specified value. If noflow rates
or  amounts  are  given,  assume  one  as  a  basis,  preferably  an
amount of a stream with known composition.
To  perform  adegree-of-freedom analysis on a single-unit
nonreactive process,  count  unknown variables  on  theflow-
chart,  then  subtract  independent  relations  among  them.  The
difference,  which  equals  the  number  of  degrees  of  freedom
for the process, must equal zero for a unique solution of the
problem  to  be  determinable.  Relations  include  material  bal-
ances (as many as there are independent species in the feed and
product   streams),   process   specifications,   density   relations
between labeled masses and volumes, and physical constraints
(e.g., the sum of the component mass or mole fractions of a
stream must add up to 1).
To perform adegree-of-freedom analysis on a multiple-unit
process, perform separate analyses on the overall process, each
process unit, each stream mixing or stream splitting point, and,
if necessary, on combinations of process units. When youfind a
system  with  zero  degrees  of  freedom,  assume  that  you  can
solve for the unknown variables in the feed and output streams
for that system; then, considering those variables as known, try
tofind  another  system  with  zero  degrees  of  freedom.  This
procedure  helps  you  tofind  an  efficient  solution  procedure
before you undertake time-consuming calculations.
Once you have written the system equations for a process, you
may solve them either manually or using an equation-solving
computer  program.If you solve system equations manually,
write them in an order that minimizes the number that must
be solved simultaneously,starting with equations that only
involve one unknown variable.
Recycleis a common feature of chemical processes. Its most
common use is to send unused raw materials emerging from a
172CHAPTER 4Fundamentals of Material Balances

process  unit  back  to  the  unit.  Overall  system  balances  are
usually (but not always) convenient starting points for analyz-
ing a process with recycle. Apurgestream is withdrawn from a
process  when  a  species  enters  in  the  process  feed  and  is
completely recycled. If this species were not removed in the
purge, it would keep accumulating in the process system and
eventually lead to shutdown.
Thelimiting reactantin a reactive process is the one that would
be completely consumed if the reaction proceeded to completion.
All other reactants must either be fed instoichiometric propor-
tionto the limiting reactant (the feed rates are in the ratio of the
stoichiometric coefficients) or inexcessof the limiting reactant
(in greater than stoichiometric proportion to it).
Thetheoretical requirementfor  an  excess  reactant  is  the
amount required to react completely with the limiting reactant.
Thepercentage excessof the reactant is
%excess
amount fedamount theoretically required
amount theoretically required
The percentage excess depends only on the feed rates of the
excess  and  limiting  reactants  and  on  their  stoichiometric
coefficients; it doesnotdepend on how much actually reacts
or on anything else that happens in the reactor.
Thefractional conversionof a reactant is the ratio of amount
reacted to amount fed. The fractional conversions of different
reactants are generally different unless the reactants are fed in
stoichiometric proportion.

species, you can determineξby applying this equation to
that species. You may then substitute the calculated value
into the equations for the other species in the stream leaving
the reactor to determine the amounts orflow rates of those
species.
You  may  analyze  reactive  processes  using  (a)molecular
species balances(the  only  method  used  for  nonreactive
processes),  (b)atomic species balances,or(c)extents
of reaction.  Molecular  species  balances  on  reactive  pro-
cesses are often cumbersome: they must include generation
and consumption terms for each species, and one degree of
freedom  must  be  added  for  each  independent  reaction.
Atomic  species  balances  have  the  simple  forminput

convenient for reaction equilibrium calculations.
Combustionis a rapid reaction between a fuel and oxygen.
The   carbon   in   the   fuel   is   oxidized   to   CO
2
(complete
combustion)orCO(partial combustion) and the hydrogen
in the fuel is oxidized to water. Other species in the fuel like
sulfur and nitrogen may be partially or completely converted
to  their  oxides.  Combustion  reactions  are  carried  out  com-

4.9.Inside a distillation column (see Problem 4.8), a downward-flowing liquid and an upward-flowing
vapor maintain contact with each other. For reasons we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 6, the
vapor stream becomes increasingly rich in the more volatile components of the mixture as it moves
up the column, and the liquid stream is enriched in the less volatile components as it moves down.
The vapor leaving the top of the column goes to a condenser. A portion of the condensate is taken off
as a product (theoverhead product), and the remainder (thereflux)isreturnedtothetopofthe
column  to  begin  its  downward  journey  as  the  liquid  stream.  The  condensation  process  can  be
represented as shown below:

4.10. Liquid extractionis an operation used to separate the components of a liquid mixture of two or more
species. In the simplest case, the mixture containstwo components: a solute (A) and a liquid solvent
(B). The mixture is contacted in an agitated vessel with a second liquid solvent (C) that has two key
properties: A dissolves in it, and B is immiscible or nearly immiscible with it. (For example, B may
be water, C a hydrocarbon oil, and A a species soluble in both water and oil.) Some of the A transfers
from B to C, and then the B-rich phase (the raffinate) and the C-rich phase (the extract) separate from
each other in a settling tank. If the raffinate is then contacted with fresh C in another stage, more A
will  be  transferred  from  it.  This  process  can  be  repeated  until  essentially  all  of  the  A  has  been
extracted from the B.
Shown below is aflowchart of a process in which acetic acid (A) is extracted from a mixture of

4.19.L-Serine  is  an  amino  acid  that  often  is  provided  when  intravenous  feeding  solutions  are  used  to
maintain the health of a patient. It has a molecular weight of 105, is produced by fermentation and
recovered and purified by crystallization at 10°C. Yield is enhanced by adding methanol to the system,
thereby reducing serine solubility in aqueous solutions.
An aqueous serine solution containing 30 wt% serine and 70% water is added along with methanol
to a batch crystallizer that is allowed to equilibrate at 10°C. The resulting crystals are recovered by
filtration;  liquid  passing  through  thefilter  is  known  asfiltrate,  and  the  recovered  crystals  may be
assumed in this problem to be free of adheringfiltrate. The crystals contain a mole of water for every
mole of serine and are known as amonohydrate. The crystal mass recovered in a particular laboratory

10.9% ethanol (Product Stream 2). The technician then reads a manometer attached to an orifice meter
mounted in the pipe carrying Product Stream 1, converts the reading to a volumetricflow rate using a
calibration curve, and converts that result to a massflow rate using the average density of ethanol and

Certain vegetables and fruits contain plant pigments calledcarotenoidsthat are metabolized in the body
to produce Vitamin A. Lack of Vitamin A causes an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children worldwide
to become blind every year. An approach to reducing blindness and other childhood health problems
resulting  from  this  deficiency  is  to  usegenetic engineeringof  rice—a  food  staple  in  developing
countries and economically disadvantaged regions of the world—so that rice becomes a dietary source
of Vitamin A. For example, a strain known asGolden Ricehas been genetically engineered so that it
can  produce  and  store  carotenoids  such  asβ-carotene  (which  helps  give  carrots  and  squash  their
yellow-orange color). One type of Golden Rice contains approximately 30 micrograms of carotenoids
(81%β-carotene, 16%α-carotene, and 3%β-cryptoxanthin) per gram of uncooked rice. A study has
reported that when a person eats Golden Rice, their body metabolizes 1 microgram of Vitamin A for
every 3.8 micrograms ofβ-carotene they consume.
(a)It is recommended that children between 1 and 3 years of age should get 300 micrograms of
Vitamin A per day. Considering only the metabolism ofβ-carotene given above, how many
grams of Golden Rice would a child have to eat in order to obtain this much Vitamin A? Does
this seem like a reasonable amount of rice to eat in one day, if one cup of cooked rice is
approximately 175 g?
(b)α-carotene  andβ-cryptoxanthin  can  also  be converted  into  Vitamin  A,  but when  compared  to
β-carotene, it takes twice as much of each of these compounds to produce one unit of Vitamin A.
Considering all of the carotenoids in Golden Rice as potential sources of Vitamin A, how many
grams of Golden Rice would a three-year-old child have to eat in order to obtain the recommended
daily amount of Vitamin A?

spectrophotometer. A beam of light passes through the chamber, and the spectrophotometer measures
the intensity of the transmitted beam and displays the value of the solution absorbance (a quantity that
increases with the amount of light absorbed by the sample). The value displayed is 0.18. A calibration

4.36. Gas absorptionorgas scrubbingis  a  commonly  used  method  for  removing  environmentally
undesirable  species  from  waste  gases  in  chemical  manufacturing  and  combustion  processes.  The
waste gas is contacted with a liquid solvent in which the potential pollutants are soluble and the other
species in the waste gas are relatively insoluble. Most of the pollutants go into solution and emerge with
the liquid effluent from the scrubber, and the cleaned gas is discharged to the atmosphere. The liquid
effluent may be sent to a waste lagoon or subjected to further treatment to recover the solvent and/or to
convert the pollutant to a species that can be released safely to the environment.
A  waste  gas containing  SO
2
(a  precursor  of  acid rain)  and  several  other  species  (collectively
designated as A) is fed to a scrubbing tower where it contacts a solvent (B) that absorbs SO
2
. The
solvent feed rate to the tower is 1000 L/min. The specific gravity of the solvent is 1.30. Absorption of A
and evaporation of B in the scrubber may be neglected.

The gas in the scrubber rises through a series oftrays(metal plates perforated with many small holes),
and the solventflows over the trays and throughdowncomersto the trays below. Gas bubbles emerge
from the holes in each tray and rise through the covering liquid, and SO
2
transfers from the bubbles and
into solution.
The volumetricflow rate of the feed gas is determined with an orifice meter, with a differential

The hormoneestrogenis produced in the ovaries of females and elsewhere in the body in men and post-
menopausal women, and it is also administered in estrogen replacement therapy, a common treatment
for women who have undergone a hysterectomy. Unfortunately, it also binds to estrogen receptors in
breast tissue and can activate cells to become cancerous.Tamoxifenis a drug that also binds to estrogen
receptors  but  does  not  activate  cells,  in  effect  blocking  the  receptors  from  access  to  estrogen  and
inhibiting the growth of breast-cancer cells.
Tamoxifen  is  administered  in  tablet  form.  In  the  manufacturing  process,  afinely ground  powder
contains tamoxifen (tam) and two inactivefillers—lactose monohydrate (lac) and corn starch (cs). The
powder is mixed with a second stream containing water and suspended solid particles of polyvinylpyrro-
lidone (pvp) binder, which keeps the tablets from easily crumbling. The slurry leaving the mixer goes to a
dryer, in which 94.2% of the water fed to the process is vaporized. The wet powder leaving the dryer contains
8.80 wt% tam, 66.8% lac, 21.4% cs, 2.00% pvp, and 1.00% water. After some additional processing, the
powder is molded into tablets. To produce a hundred thousand tablets, 17.13 kg of wet powder is required.
(a)Taking a basis of 100,000 tablets produced, draw and label a processflowchart, labeling masses of
individual components rather than total masses and component mass fractions. It is unnecessary to
label the stream between the mixer and the dryer. Carry out a degree-of-freedom analysis of the
overall two-unit process.
(b)Calculate the masses and compositions of the streams that must enter the mixer to make 100,000
tablets.
(c)Why  was  it  unnecessary  to  label  the  stream  between  the  mixer  and  the  dryer?  Under  what
circumstances would it have been necessary?
(d)Go back to theflowchart of Part (a). Without using the mass of the wet powder (17.13 kg) or any of
the  results  from  Part  (b)  in  your  calculations,  determine  the  mass  fractions  of  the  stream
components in the powder fed to the mixer and verify that they match your solution to Part (b).
(Hint: Take a basis of 100 kg of wet powder.)
(e)Suppose a student does Part (d) before Part (b), and re-labels the powder feed to the mixer on the
flowchart of Part (a) with an unknown total mass (m
1
) and the three now known mole fractions.
(Sketch the resultingflowchart.) The student then does a degree-of-freedom analysis, counts
four unknowns (the masses of the powder, pvp, and water fed to the mixer, and the mass of
water evaporated in the dryer), and six equations (five material balances forfive species and the
percentage evaporation), for a net of2 degrees of freedom. Since there are more equations than
unknowns, it should not be possible to get a unique solution for the four unknowns. Never-
theless, the student writes four equations, solves for the four unknowns, and verifies that all of

4.40.A liquid mixture containing 30.0 mole% benzene (B), 25.0% toluene (T), and the balance xylene (X) is
fed to a distillation column. The bottoms product contains 98.0 mole% X and no B, and 96.0% of the X
in the feed is recovered in this stream. The overhead product is fed to a second column. The overhead
product from the second column contains 97.0% of the B in the feed to this column. The composition of
this stream is 94.0 mole% B and the balance T.
(a)Draw and label aflowchart of this process and do the degree-of-freedom analysis to prove that for
an assumed basis of calculation, molarflow rates and compositions of all process streams can be
calculated from the given information. Write in order the equations you would solve to calculate
unknown  process  variables.  In  each  equation  (or  pair  of  simultaneous  equations),  circle  the
variable(s) for which you would solve. Do not do the calculations.
(b)Calculate (i) the percentage of the benzene in the process feed (i.e., the feed to thefirst column) that

4.41.Seawater containing 3.50 wt% salt passes through a series of 10 evaporators. Roughly equal quantities
of water are vaporized in each of the 10 units and then condensed and combined to obtain a product
stream of fresh water. The brine leaving each evaporator but the tenth is fed to the next evaporator. The
brine leaving the tenth evaporator contains 5.00 wt% salt.

Inside the column a liquid streamflows downward and a vapor stream rises. At each point in the column
some of the liquid vaporizes and some of the vapor condenses. The vapor leaving the top of the column,
which contains 97 mole% benzene, is completely condensed and split into two equal fractions: one is
taken off as the overhead product stream, and the other (thereflux) is recycled to the top of the column.
The overhead product stream contains 89.2% of the benzene fed to the column. The liquid leaving the
bottom of the column is fed to a partial reboiler in which 45% of it is vaporized. The vapor generated in
the reboiler (theboilup) is recycled to become the rising vapor stream in the column, and the residual
reboiler liquid is taken off as the bottom product stream. The compositions of the streams leaving the
reboiler are governed by the relation

and identify a system with which the process analysis might appropriately begin (one with zero
degrees of freedom).

the bottoms product, and the percentage recovery of toluene in the bottoms product (100×moles

4.43.The popularity of orange juice, especially as a breakfast drink, makes this beverage an important factor
in the economy of orange-growing regions. Most marketed juice is concentrated and frozen and then
reconstituted before consumption, and some is“not-from-concentrate.”Although concentrated juices
are less popular in the United States than they were at one time, they still have a major segment of the
market for orange juice.
The approaches to concentrating orange juice include evaporation,freeze concentration, and
reverse osmosis. Here we examine the evaporation process by focusing only on two constituents in the
juice: solids and water. Fresh orange juice contains approximately 10 wt% solids (sugar, citric acid, and
other ingredients) and frozen concentrate contains approximately 42 wt% solids. The frozen concen-
trate is obtained by evaporating water from the fresh juice to produce a mixture that is approximately
65 wt% solids. However, so that theflavor of the concentrate will closely approximate that of fresh
juice, the concentrate from the evaporator is blended with fresh orange juice (and other additives) to
produce afinal concentrate that is approximately 42 wt% solids.
(a)Draw and label aflowchart of this process, neglecting the vaporization of everything in the juice
but water. First prove that the subsystem containing the point where the bypass stream splits off
from  the  evaporator  feed  has  one  degree  of  freedom.  (If  you  think  it  has  zero  degrees,  try
determining the unknown variables associated with this system.) Then perform the degree-of-
freedom  analysis  for  the  overall  system,  the  evaporator,  and  the  bypass–evaporator  product
mixing point, and write in order the equations you would solve to determine allunknown stream
variables.  In each equation,  circle the variable for  which you would  solve,  but  don’tdoany
calculations.
(b)Calculate the amount of product (42% concentrate) produced per 100 kg fresh juice fed to the
process and the fraction of the feed that bypasses the evaporator.
(c)Most of the volatile ingredients that provide the taste of the concentrate are contained in the fresh juice
that  bypasses  the  evaporator.  You  could  get  more  of  these  ingredients  in  thefinal  product  by
evaporating to (say) 90% solids instead of 65%; you could then bypass a greater fraction of the fresh
juice and thereby obtain an even better tasting product. Suggest possible drawbacks to this proposal.
4.44.Effluents from metal-finishing plants have the potential of discharging undesirable quantities of metals,
such as cadmium, nickel, lead, manganese, and chromium, in forms that are detrimental to water and air
quality. A local metal-finishing plant has identified a wastewater stream that contains 5.15 wt% chromium
(Cr)  and  devised  the  following  approach  to  lowering  risk  and  recovering  the  valuable  metal.  The
wastewater stream is fed to a treatment unit that removes 95% of the chromium in the feed and recycles it to

the plant. The residual liquid stream leaving the treatment unit is sent to a waste lagoon. The treatment unit
has a maximum capacity of 4500 kg wastewater/h. If wastewater leaves thefinishing plant at a rate higher
than the capacity of the treatment unit, the excess (anything above 4500 kg/h) bypasses the unit and
combines with the residual liquid leaving the unit, and the combined stream goes to the waste lagoon.

4.47.In anabsorption tower(orabsorber), a gas is contacted with a liquid under conditions such that one
or more species in the gas dissolve in the liquid. Astripping tower(orstripper) also involves a gas
contacting a liquid, but under conditions such that one or more components of the feed liquid come out
of solution and exit in the gas leaving the tower.
A  process  consisting  of  an  absorption  tower  and  a  stripping  tower  is  used  to  separate  the
components of a gas containing 30.0 mole% carbon dioxide and the balance methane. A stream of this
gas is fed to the bottom of the absorber. A liquid containing 0.500 mole% dissolved CO
2
and the
balance  methanol  is  recycled  from  the  bottom  of  the  stripper  and  fed  to  the  top  of  the  absorber.
The product gas leaving the top of the absorber contains 1.00 mole% CO
2
and essentially all of the
methane fed to the unit. The CO
2
-rich liquid solvent leaving the bottom of the absorber is fed to the
top of the stripper and a stream of nitrogen gas is fed to the bottom. Ninety percent of the CO
2
in the
liquid feed to the stripper comes out of solution in the column, and the nitrogen/CO
2
stream leaving
the column passes out to the atmosphere through a stack. The liquid stream leaving the stripping
tower is the 0.500% CO

4.48.In the production of a bean oil, beans containing 13.0 wt% oil and 87.0% solids are ground and fed to a
stirred tank (theextractor) along with a recycled stream of liquidn-hexane. The feed ratio is 3 kg
hexane/kg beans. The ground beans are suspended in the liquid, and essentially all of the oil in the
beans is extracted into the hexane. The extractor effluent passes to afilter where the solids are collected
and form afilter cake. Thefilter cake contains 75.0 wt% bean solids and the balance bean oil and
hexane, the latter two in the same ratio in which they emerge from the extractor. Thefilter cake is
discarded and the liquidfiltrate is fed to a heated evaporator in which the hexane is vaporized and the oil
remains as a liquid. The oil is stored in drums and shipped. The hexane vapor is subsequently cooled
and condensed, and the liquid hexane condensate is recycled to the extractor.

Boilers are used in most chemical plants to generate steam for various purposes, such as to preheat
process streams fed to reactors and separation units. In one such process, steam and a cold processfluid
are fed to a heat exchanger where enough energy is transferred from the steam to cause a large fraction
of it to condense. The uncondensed steam is vented to the atmosphere, and the liquid condensate is
recycled to a deaerator into which another liquid stream (makeup water) is fed. The makeup water
contains some dissolved impurities and other chemicals that help prevent deposition of solids on boiler
walls and heating elements, which would lead to a reduction in operating efficiency and eventually to
safety hazards, possibly including explosions. The liquid leaving the deaerator is the feed to the boiler.
In the boiler, most of the water in the feed evaporates to form steam, and some of the impurities in the
feedwater precipitate to form solid particles suspended in the liquid (kept in suspension by the chemical
additives in the makeup water). The liquid and suspended solids are drawn off asboiler blowdown,
either in manual bursts or with a continuous blowdown system.
A diagram of the system is shown below. The symbol I is used for combined impurities and

4.51.A drug (D) is produced in a three-stage extraction from the leaves of a tropical plant. About 1000 kg of leaf is
required to produce 1 kg of the drug. The extraction solvent (S) is a mixture containing 16.5 wt% ethanol (E)
and the balance water (W). The following process is carried out to extract the drug and recover the solvent.
1.A mixing tank is charged with 3300 kg of S and 620 kg of leaf. The mixer contents are stirred for
several hours, during which a portion of the drug contained in the leaf goes into solution. The
contents of the mixer are then discharged through afilter. The liquidfiltrate, which carries over
roughly 1% of the leaf fed to the mixer, is pumped to a holding tank, and the solid cake (spent leaf
and entrained liquid) is sent to a second mixer. The entrained liquid has the same composition as the

filtrate and a mass equal to 15% of the mass of liquid charged to the mixer. The extracted drug has a
negligible effect on the total mass and volume of the spent leaf and thefiltrate.
2.The second mixer is charged with the spent leaf from thefirst mixer and with thefiltrate from the
previous batch in the third mixer. The leaf is extracted for several more hours, and the contents of
the mixer are then discharged to a secondfilter. Thefiltrate, which contains 1% of the leaf fed to the
second mixer, is pumped to the same holding tank that received thefiltrate from thefirst mixer, and
the solid cake—spent leaf and entrained liquid—is sent to the third mixer. The entrained liquid mass
is 15% of the mass of liquid charged to the second mixer.
3.The third mixer is charged with the spent leaf from the second mixer and with 2720 kg of solvent S.
The mixer contents arefiltered; thefiltrate, which contains 1% of the leaf fed to the third mixer, is
recycled to the second mixer; and the solid cake is discarded. As before, the mass of the entrained
liquid in the solid cake is 15% of the mass of liquid charged to the mixer.
4.The contents of thefiltrate holding tank arefiltered to remove the carried-over spent leaf, and the
wet cake is pressed to recover entrained liquid, which is combined with thefiltrate. A negligible
amount of liquid remains in the wet cake. Thefiltrate, which contains D, E, and W, is pumped to an
extraction unit (another mixer).
5.In the extraction unit, the alcohol–water–drug solution is contacted with another solvent (F), which
is almost but not completely immiscible with ethanol and water. Essentially all of the drug (D) is
extracted into the second solvent, from which it is eventually separated by a process of no concern in
this problem. Some ethanol but no water is also contained in the extract. The solution from which
the drug has been extracted (theraffinate) contains 13.0 wt% E, 1.5% F, and 85.5% W. It is fed to a
stripping column for recovery of the ethanol.
6.The feeds to the stripping column are the solution just described and steam. The two streams are fed
in a ratio such that the overhead product stream from the column contains 20.0 wt% E and 2.6% F,
and the bottom product stream contains 1.3 wt% E and the balance W.

While most carbon nanotube research has been based on laboratory-scale synthesis, commercial

with  an  organo-metallic  compound  (iron  penta-carbonyl)  is  decomposed  at  high  temperature  and
pressure to form CNT, amorphous carbon, and CO

In the process to be analyzed, a fresh feed of CO saturated with Fe(CO)
5
(v) contains 19.2 wt% of
the latter component. The feed is joined by a recycle stream of pure CO and fed to the reactor, where all
of the iron penta-carbonyl decomposes. Based on laboratory data, 20.0% of the CO fed to the reactor is
converted, and the selectivity of CNT to amorphous carbon production is (9.00 kmol CNT/kmol C).
The reactor effluent passes through a complex separation process that yields three product streams: one
consists of solid CNT, C, and Fe; a second is CO
2
; and the third is the recycled CO. You wish to
determine theflow rate of the fresh feed (SCM/h), the total CO
2
generated in the process (kg/h), and the
ratio (kmol CO recycled/kmol CO in fresh feed).
(a)Take a basis of 100 kmol fresh feed. Draw and fully label a processflow chart and do degree-of-
freedom analyses for the overall process, the fresh-feed/recycle mixing point, the reactor, and the
separation process. Base the analyses for reactive systems on atomic balances.
(b)Write and solve overall balances, and then scale the process to calculate theflow rate (SCM/h) of fresh
feed required to produce 1000 kg CNT/h and the massflow rate of CO
2
that would be produced.
(c)In your degree-of-freedom analysis of the reactor, you might have counted separate balances for
C (atomic carbon) and O (atomic oxygen). In fact, those two balances are not independent, so one
but not both of them should be counted. Revise your analysis if necessary, and then calculate the
ratio (kmol CO recycled/kmol CO in fresh feed).
(d)Prove that the atomic carbon and oxygen balances on the reactor are not independent equations.

4.76.Methanol is produced by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen. A fresh feed stream containing CO
and H
2
joins a recycle stream and the combined stream is fed to a reactor. The reactor outlet stream
flows at a rate of 350 mol/min and contains 10.6 wt% H
2
, 64.0 wt% CO, and 25.4 wt% CH
3
OH. (Notice
that those are percentages by mass, not mole percents.) This stream enters a cooler in which most of the
methanol is condensed. The liquid methanol condensate is withdrawn as a product, and the gas stream
leaving the condenser—which contains CO, H
2
, and 0.40 mole% uncondensed CH
3
OH vapor—is the
recycle stream that combines with the fresh feed.
(a)Without doing any calculations, prove that you have enough information to determine (i) the molar
flow rates of CO and H

in the fresh feed, (ii) the production rate of liquid methanol, and (iii) the
single-pass and overall conversions of carbon monoxide. Then perform the calculations.
(b)After several months of operation, theflow rate of liquid methanol leaving the condenser begins to
decrease. List at least three possible explanations of this behavior and state how you might check
the validity of each one. (What would you measure and what would you expect tofind if the
explanation is valid?)
4.77.Methane reacts with chlorine to produce methyl chloride and hydrogen chloride. Once formed, the
methyl chloride may undergo further chlorination to form methylene chloride (CH

Cl

), chloroform,
and carbon tetrachloride.
A methyl chloride production process consists of a reactor, a condenser, a distillation column,
and an absorption column. A gas stream containing80.0 mole% methane and the balance chlorine is
fed to the reactor. In the reactor a single-pass chlorine conversion of essentially 100% is attained, the
mole ratio of methyl chloride to methylene chloride in the product is 5:1, and negligible amounts of
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride are formed. The product streamflows to the condenser. Two
streams  emerge  from  the  condenser:  the  liquid condensate,  which  contains  essentially  all  of  the
methyl chloride and methylene chloride in the reactor effluent, and a gas containing the methane and
hydrogen  chloride. The condensate goes to the distillation column in which the two component
species  are  separated.  The  gas  leaving  the  condenserflows  to  the  absorption  column  where  it
contacts an aqueous solution. The solution absorbs essentially all of the HCl and none of the CH

the methane is recycled to join the fresh feed to the process (a mixture of methane and chlorine). The
combined stream is the feed to the reactor.
(a)Choose a quantity of the reactor feed as a basis of calculation, draw and label aflowchart, and
determine the degrees of freedom for the overall process and each single unit and stream mixing
point. Then write in order the equations you would use to calculate the molarflow rate and molar
composition of the fresh feed, the rate at which HCl must be removed in the absorber, the methyl
chloride production rate, and the molarflow rate of the recycle stream. Do no calculations.

The feed to the reactor (notthe fresh feed to the process) contains 3 moles of ethylene per mole of

in the reactor, 90 moles of ethylene oxide emerge in the reactor products. A multiple-unit process is
used to separate the products: ethylene and oxygen are recycled to the reactor, ethylene oxide is sold as
a product, and carbon dioxide and water are discarded.

To meet the stoichiometric requirements of the processandremain outside of theflammable zone, the
oxygen concentration entering the reactor is maintained at 14.0 mole%.
A water quench followed by a pair of separation columns is used to isolate and purify the acrolein
product. In the quench tower, all of the acrylic acid from the reactor effluent is absorbed in liquid water
recycled from Column 2. Of the water entering the quench tower in the reactor effluent and recycle
streams, half emerges with the acrylic acid liquid stream and the other half emerges in the gas stream
fed to Column 1.
The oxygen and nitrogen entering Column 1 emerge in the product stream leaving the top of the
column, from which a fractionZ
p
is taken off as purge while the remainder is recycled to the reactor.
The acrolein  and water  entering Column 1 are recovered  in a liquid  stream  leaving the bottom of
Column 1 and sent to Column 2. The product stream from the top of Column 2 is a liquid mixture
containing 97.0 mole% acrolein, which represents essentially all of the acrolein entering the column,
and 3.0 mole% water. The product stream leaving the bottom of Column 2 is essentially pure liquid
water and is the recycle stream fed to the quench tower.

The gas stream is split into two fractions: one is removed from the process as a purge stream, and the
other is the recycle stream that combines with the fresh feed to the reactor.

4.81.The fresh feed to an ammonia production process contains nitrogen and hydrogen in stoichiometric

of  nitrogen  is  achieved.  The  reactor  effluentflows  to  a  condenser.  A  liquid  stream  containing
essentially all of the ammonia formed in the reactor and a gas stream containing all the inerts and the
unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen leave the condenser. The gas stream is split into two fractions with
the same composition: one is removed from the process as a purge stream, and the other is the recycle
stream combined with the fresh feed.In every stream containing nitrogen and hydrogen,the two
species are in stoichiometric proportion.

separate recycle streams, as shown in theflowchart, and the combined stream enters the reactor. Essentially
all of the butylene fed to the reactor is consumed. A portion of the reactor effluent is recycled to the reactor
inlet and the remainder passes to a decanter, in which the aqueous (sulfuric acid) and hydrocarbon phases are
allowed to separate. The acid is recycled to the reactor, and the hydrocarbons pass to a distillation column.
Problems207

The overhead from the column contains iso-octane andn-butane, and the bottoms product, which is recycled

According to this equation, CO

and CO should be in a ratio of 1/1 in the reaction products, but
in the product gas of Part (a) they are in a ratio of 24.8/6.12. Is that result possible? (Hint:Yes.)
Explain how.
4.91.A mixture of 75 mole% methane and 25 mole% hydrogen is burned with 25% excess air. Fractional
conversions of 90% of the methane and 85% of the hydrogen are achieved; of the methane that reacts,
95% reacts to form CO
2
and the balance reacts to form CO. The hot combustion product gas passes
through a boiler in which heat transferred from the gas converts boiler feedwater into steam.
(a)Calculate the concentration of CO (ppm) in the stack gas.
(b)The CO in the stack gas is a pollutant. Its concentration can be decreased by increasing the percent
excess air fed to the furnace. Think of at least two costs of doing so. (Hint:The heat released by the
combustion  goes  into  heating  the  combustion  products;  the  higher  the  combustion  product
temperature, the more steam is produced.)
4.92.n-Pentane is burned with excess air in a continuous combustion chamber.
(a)A technician runs an analysis and reports that the product gas contains 0.270 mole% pentane,
5.3% oxygen, 9.1% carbon dioxide, and the balance nitrogenon a dry basis. Assume 100 mol of
dry  product  gas  as  a  basis  of  calculation,  draw  and  label  aflowchart,  perform  a  degree-of-
freedom analysis based on atomic species balances, and show that the system has–1degreeof

(b)Use balances to prove that the reported percentages could not possibly be correct.
(c)The  technician  reruns  the  analysis  and  reports  new  values  of  0.304 mole%  pentane,  5.9%
oxygen, 10.2% carbon dioxide, and the balance nitrogen. Verify that this resultcouldbe correct
and, assuming that it is, calculate the percent excess air fed to the reactor and the fractional

(c)Suppose the combustion products are released directly into a room. What potential problems do
you see and what remedies can you suggest?
4.94.A gas containing methane, ethane, and carbon dioxide is analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC) and
flame ionization detector (FID): the GC separates the components of the gas, and the FID registers
signals proportional to the amount of each hydrocarbon (but not CO

The area under each peak is proportional to the number of carbon atoms in the sample, so that 1 mol of
ethane would yield a peak with twice the area of a peak corresponding to 1 mol of methane.
This fuel is being burned with air in a continuous combustion chamber. The molar feed ratio of air
to fuel was supposed to be 7:1, but you suspect the airflowmeter is not functioning properly. To check
it, you take a 0.50-mol sample of the product gas and pass it through a condenser, which condenses
essentially all of the water in the sample. The condensate (which can be assumed to be pure water) is
weighed and found to have a mass of 1.134 g. The dry gas leaving the condenser is analyzed and found
to contain no hydrocarbons, no CO, and 11.9% CO

(a)Calculate the molar composition (component mole fractions) of the fuel gas and the desired percent
excess air.
(b)Calculate the actual molar feed ratio of air to fuel and the actual percent excess air.
4.95.A  mixture  of  propane  and  butane  is  burned  with  pure  oxygen.  The  combustion  products  contain

(a)What is the mole percent of propane in the fuel?
(b)It now turns out that the fuel mixture may contain not only propane and butane but also other

calculate  the  elemental  molar  composition  of  the  fuel  from  the  given  combustion  product
analysis  (i.e.,  what  mole  percent  is  C  and  what  percent  is  H).  Prove  that  your  solution  is
consistent with the result of Part (a).
4.96.A fuel oil is analyzed and found to contain 85.0 wt% carbon, 12.0% elemental hydrogen (H), 1.7%
sulfur, and the remainder noncombustible matter. The oil is burned with 20.0% excess air, based on
complete  combustion  of  the  carbon  to  CO

(c)Emitted  sulfur  dioxide  by  itself  is  a  health  hazard,  but  it  is  a  more  serious  threat  to  the
environment  as  a  precursor  toacid rain.Under  the  catalytic  action  of  sunlight,  the  sulfur
dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide, which in turn combines with water vapor to form sulfuric
acid, which eventually returns to earth as rainfall. Acid rain formed in this manner has caused
extensive  damage  to  forests,fields,  and  lakes  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  For  the  furnace
described above, calculate the rate of formation of sulfuric acid (kg/h) if all the emitted SO

converted in the indicated manner.

first chosen state, pick a neighboring state.
4.98.The composition of a coal is determined by aproximate analysis.The coal isfirstfinely ground and
air-dried. Samples of the dried coal are then subjected to several operations, with the sample weights
being recorded before and after each operation.Moisture contentis determined as the weight loss when
a sample is held at 105°C in an oxygen-free atmosphere for roughly 2 h, added to the weight loss in the
initial drying step.Volatile matter(primarily organic tars) is determined by holding a sample at 925°C
in an oxygen-free atmosphere for 7 min and subtracting the moisture loss from the total weight loss.
Ash(ormineral matter—oxides and sulfates of silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sulfur, and trace
minerals) is the residue that remains after a sample has been heated to 800°C in an oxygen-containing
atmosphere until all the organic matter has been burned away.Fixed carbonis what is present in coal

At one point during the operation of the process, the scrubber removes 90% of the SO

the superintendent replies that they sometimes use a fuel oil but the plant log shows that they were not
doing so when the measurements were made. You do some calculations and prove that the oil and not
the gas must have been the fuel; the superintendent checks further and discovers that the plant log is in
error and you are right.

CHAPTER
5
Single-Phase Systems
Most of the material balance problems in Chapter 4 could be solved entirely from information
given in the problem statements. As you will come to discover, problems in process analysis are
rarely so conveniently self-contained; before you can carry out a complete material balance on a
process, you usually must determine various physical properties of the process materials and use
these properties to derive additional relations among the system variables. The following methods
can be used to determine a physical property of a process material:
Look It Up.When you need a value for a physical property of a substance—whether it be a
density,  vapor  pressure,  solubility,  or  heat  capacity—there  is  a  good  chance  that  someone,
somewhere has measured this property and published the result. Since experiments are usually
costly and time consuming, a reliable source of physical property data is an invaluable asset in
process analysis. Three excellent sources of data are the following:
Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook,  8th  Edition,  R.  H.  Perry  and  D.  W.  Green,  Eds.,
McGraw-Hill, New York, 2008.
CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,  95th  Edition,  D.  Lide,  Ed.,  Chemical  Rubber
Company, Boca Raton, FL, 2014.
NIST Chemistry WebBook(
http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) is an excellent source of on-line
information regarding thermochemical, thermophysical, and other resources compiled by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology.
If the desired information cannot be found in these references, the species in question can be
looked up in the index ofChemical Abstractsin an effort to locate data in the open literature.
Estimate It.There are a relatively small number of atomic elements and a much larger but still
countable number of molecular species of interest to chemical engineers. Chemical species can be
combined into mixtures in an infinite number of ways, however, and it is clearly impossible to
tabulate physical property data for even a small fraction of the possible combinations. Moreover,
even when data are found they are likely to have been determined for conditions other than the
ones for which you need them. Poling, Prausnitz, and O’Connell
1
summarize a large number of
empirical correlations that express physical properties of a mixture in terms of the pure-component
properties  and  the  mixture  composition.  These  correlations  can  be  used  to  estimate  physical
properties when no data are available and to extrapolate available data to conditions other than the
ones at which the data were obtained.
Measure It.When no information on a particular physical property of a substance can be found
in the literature or when the property must be known with a precision greater than that provided by
general  estimation  formulas,  the  only  recourse  is  to  determine  the  property  experimentally.
Information on experimental techniques for measuring physical properties can be found in any of
numerous texts on experimental physical, organic, and analytical chemistry.
Density  is  a  frequently  needed  physical  property  of  a  processfluid.  For  example,
engineers often know volumetricflow rates

discussion to nonideal gases.
5.0LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
Explain in your own words and without the use of jargon (a) the three ways of obtaining values
of physical properties; (b) why somefluids are referred to as incompressible; (c) the“liquid
volume additivity assumption”and the species for which it is most likely to be valid; (d) the
term“equation of state”; (e) what it means to assume ideal-gas behavior; (f) what it means to
say that the specific volume of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure is 22.4 L/mol;
(g) the meaning of partial pressure; (h) why volume fraction and mole fraction for ideal gases
are identical; (i) what the compressibility factor,z, represents, and what its value indicates about
the validity of the ideal-gas equation of state; (j) why certain equations of state are referred to as
cubic; and (k) the physical meaning of critical temperature and pressure (explain them in terms
of what happens when a vapor either below or above its critical temperature is compressed).
For a mixture of liquids with known composition, determineV(or
_
V) from a knownmor
_
mor
vice versa using (a) tabulated density data for the mixture and (b) pure-component densities and
an assumption of volume additivity. Derive the density estimation formula for the second case
(Equation 5.1-1).
Given any three of the quantitiesP;V(or
_
V),n(or
_
n), andTfor an ideal gas, (a) calculate the
fourth  either  directly  from  the  ideal-gas  equation  of  state  or  by  conversion  from  standard
conditions; (b) calculate the density of the gas; and (c) test the assumption of ideality either by
using a rule of thumb about the specific volume or by estimating a compressibility factor and
seeing how much it differs from 1.
Explain the meaning of“37.5 SCFH”(37.5 standard cubic feet per hour) and what it means to
say that theflow rate of a gas stream at 120°F and 2.8 atm is 37.5 SCFH. (Why doesn’t this
statement  specify  the  impossible  condition  that  the  gas  is  at  two  sets  of  temperatures  and
pressures simultaneously?) Calculate the true volumetricflow rate of that gas.
Given  the  component  partial  pressures  of  an  ideal-gas  mixture  and  the  total  gas  pressure,
determine  the  mixture  composition  expressed  in  either  mole  fractions  (or  mole  percents),
volume fractions (or % v/v), or mass fractions (or % w/w).
Carry outPVTcalculations for a gas using (a) the truncated virial equation of state, (b) the van
der Waals equation of state, (c) the SRK equation of state, and (d) the compressibility factor
equation of state with either tabulated compressibility factors or a generalized compressibility
chart for a single species and Kay’s rule for a nonideal mixture of gases.
Given a description of a process system in which a volumetricflow rate is either specified or
requested for any process stream, (a) carry out the degree-of-freedom analysis, including
density estimates for liquid and solid streams and equations of state for gas streams; (b) write
the system equations and  outline the procedure  you  would  use  to  solve  for  all requested
quantities; (c) carry out the calculations; (d) list all your assumptions (e.g., volume additivity
for liquids or ideal-gas behavior) and state whether or not they are reasonable for the given
process conditions.

5.1LIQUID AND SOLID DENSITIES
Specific gravities of solids and liquids were discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Values for several
substances at a single temperature are listed in Table B.1 in Appendix B, and more extensive
tabulations can be found inPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook
2
on pp. 2-7 through 2-47 and
2-96 through 2-125.
When you heat a liquid or a solid it normally expands (i.e., its density decreases). In most
process applications, however, it can be assumed with little error that solid and liquid densities are
independent of temperature. Similarly, changes in pressure do not cause significant changes in
liquid or solid densities; these substances are therefore termedincompressible.
Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(pp. 2-96 and 2-97) lists densities of liquid water and
mercury at different temperatures and gives expressions on pp. 2-134 through 2-136 that may be
used to calculate densities for many other substances at different temperatures. Poling, Prausnitz,
and O’Connell (see Footnote 1) present a number of methods to estimate the density of a liquid for
which tabulated values are not available. Some of these estimation formulas are also given in
Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbookon pp. 2-497 through 2-504.
The most accurate way to determine the density of a mixture of liquids or a solution of a solid in a
liquid is from experimental data.Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbookprovides data for mixtures
and solutions of a number of substances on pp. 2-104 through 2-123 and lists additional sources of data
on p. 2-104.
In  the  absence  of  data,  the  density
ρof  a  mixture  ofnliquidsA
1
;A
2
;...;A
n
can  be
estimated from the component mass fractionsx
i
and pure-component densitiesρ
i
in two ways.
First, we might assumevolume additivity—that is, if 2 mL of liquid A and 3 mL of liquid B are
mixed, the resulting volume would be exactly 5 mL. Making this assumption and recognizing that
component masses are always additive leads to the formula
1
ρ

Second, we might simply average the pure-component densities, weighting each one by the mass
fraction of the component:

x

ρ

(5.1-2)
(Equation 5.1-1 calculates the inverse of the mixture density, or thespecific volumeof the mixture,
as the weighted average of the pure-component specific volumes.)
One of these estimation formulas might work better for some species and the other might
work better for other species. For example, Figure 5.1-1 shows densities of both methanol–water
and sulfuric acid–water mixtures at 20°C. The densities for each pair of components are obtained
in three ways: from experimental data inPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(p. 2-112 for
sulfuric  acid  solutions  and  p.  2-116  for  methanol  solutions),  using  Equation  5.1-1,  and  using
Equation  5.1-2.  Equation  5.1-1  provides  a  slightly  better  estimate  (i.e.,  values  closer  to  the
experimental data) for methanol and water, and Equation 5.1-2 provides a much better estimate for
sulfuric acid and water.
Which method should you use? Equation 5.1-1 and the assumption of volume additivity work
best  for  mixtures  of  liquid  species  with  similar  molecular  structures  (e.g.,  all  straight-chain
hydrocarbons of nearly equal molecular  weight, such asn-pentane,n-hexane, andn-heptane).
There  are  no  general  rules  for  when  Equation  5.1-2  works  better—all  we  can  do  is  rely  on
empirical (experimental)findings.

5.2IDEAL GASES
Looking up a density or specific volume at one temperature and pressure and using it at another
temperature and pressure usually works well for a solid or a liquid, but not at all for a gas. An
expression is needed for gases that relates specific volume to temperature and pressure, so that if
any two of these quantities are known the third can be calculated.
Typical problems that require aPVTrelationship for their solution include the following:
1.Propane at 120°C and 2.3 bar passes through aflowmeter that reads 250 L/min. What is the
massflow rate of the gas?
2.A pure hydrocarbon gasfills a two-liter vessel at 30°C with an absolute pressure of 25 atm. How
many gram-moles of gas are contained in the vessel? If the mass of the gas is 60 g, what might
the gas be?
3.A 20-ft
3
gas cylinder in your laboratory can hold pressures up to 400 atm. The Bourdon gauge
on the cylinder reads 380 atm one morning when the temperature is 55°F. How high can the
temperature go before it becomes advisable to move to a different laboratory?
Anequation of staterelates the molar quantity and volume of a gas to temperature and pressure.
The simplest and most widely used of these relationships is theideal-gas equation of state(the familiar
PVnRT), which, while approximate, isadequate for many engineeringcalculations involving gases
at low pressures. However, some gases deviate from ideal behavior at nearly all conditions and all gases
deviate substantially at certain conditions (notablyat high pressures and/or low temperatures). In such
cases it is necessary to use more complex equations of state forPVTcalculations.
In this section we discuss the ideal-gas equation of state and show how it is applied to systems
containing single gaseous substances and mixtures of gases. Section 5.3 outlines methods used for
a single nonideal gas (by definition, a gas for which the ideal-gas equation of state does not work
well) and for mixtures of nonideal gases.
5.2a  The Ideal-Gas Equation of State
The ideal-gas equation of state can be derived from the kinetic theory of gases by assuming that
gas molecules have a negligible volume, exert no forces on one another, and collide elastically
with the walls of their container. The equation usually appears in the form
PVnRTor

The equation may also be written as

where

A gas whosePVTbehavior is well represented by Equation 5.2-1 is said to behave as anideal
gasor aperfect gas.The use of this equation does not require a knowledge of the gas species:
1 mol of an ideal gas at 0°C and 1 atm occupies 22.415 liters, whether the gas is argon, nitrogen, a
mixture of propane and air, or any other single species or mixture of gases.
The gas constantRhas units ofpressurevolume/moletemperature; moreover, since
pressure  times  volume  has  units  of  energy  (prove  it),Rmay  also  be  expressed  in  units  of
energy/moletemperature. Values of the gas constant expressed in various units are listed in
the table on the inside back cover of this book.
The ideal-gas equation of state is an approximation.  It  works  well  under  some  condi-
tions—generally speaking, at temperatures above about 0°C and pressures below about 1 atm—
but at other conditions its use may lead to substantial errors. Here is a useful rule of thumb for
when it is reasonable to assume ideal-gas behavior. LetX

have a sensitive balance if you need one, but you may not assume that the average home has its
own chemistry laboratory.)
5.2b Standard Temperature and Pressure
DoingPVTcalculations by substituting given values of variables into the ideal-gas equation of
state is straightforward, but to use this method you must have on hand either a table of values ofR
with different units or a good memory. A way to avoid these requirements is to useconversion
from standard conditions.

You will frequently encounter problems that involve gases at two different states (sets of
conditions)—for example, at the inlet and outlet of a process unit. A convenient way to determine
an unknown variable (P,V,n,orT) of the gas at one of the states is to write the ideal-gas equation
of state for both states and divide one equation by the other. Any variables that are the same at both
points will cancel, leaving an equation containing only the variable you wish to determine and
known quantities. Inherent in this approach is an assumption that the ideal-gas equation of state is
valid at both sets of conditions.

You  may  on  occasion  be  told  that  theflow  rate  of  a  gas  stream  is,  say,  23.8  SCMH  [or
m
3
(STP)/h] at 150°C and 2.5 atm. This looks like a contradiction: How can a gas be at standard
temperature and pressure (0°C and 1 atm)andat 150°C and 2.5 atm? The answer is that it can’t—
the gas isnotat standard temperature and pressure. Aflow rate specified in the given manner (23.8
SCMH) is not the true volumetricflow rate of the stream at its actual temperature and pressure
(150°C and 2.5 atm) but theflow rate that would be obtainedifthe stream were brought from its
224CHAPTER 5Single-Phase Systems

actual conditions to standard temperature and pressure. From the given value of 23.8 SCMH, you
could (a) calculate the molarflow rate (kmol/h) by dividing 23:8m
3
/h by 22:4m

(STP)/kmol, or
(b)  calculate  the  true  volumetricflow  ratem

/h  by  (423 K/273 K)
(1 atm/2.5 atm). (Convince yourself of both of these claims.)

5.3EQUATIONS OF STATE FOR NONIDEAL GASES
The ideal gas is the basis of the simplest and most convenient equation of state: solving it is trivial,
regardless of which variable is unknown, and the calculation is independent of the species of the
gas and is the same for single species and mixtures. Its shortcoming is that it can be seriously
inaccurate. At a sufficiently low temperature and/or a sufficiently high pressure, a value  of
^
V
predicted with the ideal-gas equation could be off by a factor of two or three or more in either
direction. Making things worse, the predicted value for one species at a given temperature and
pressure could be much too high, that for another species at the sameTandPcould be much too
low, and that for a third species could be quite close to the true value.
In this section we introduce several more complex but more accurate equations of state for
single species: thevirial equation, thevan der Waals equation, and theSoave–Redlich–Kwong
equation. In Section 5.4 we introduce another approach to nonideal gas analysis that makes use of
thelaw of corresponding statesandcompressibility factors, and we describeKay’s rule, a method
for performingPVTcalculations on gas mixtures.
5.3a  Critical Temperature and Pressure
How well or poorly the ideal-gas equation of statefitsPVTdata for a species often depends on the
values of the system temperature and pressure relative to two physical properties of the species—
thecritical temperatureT

their physical significance and then see how they are used in nonideal-gas calculations.
Suppose a quantity of water is kept in a closed piston-fitted cylinder.

O
(T,P)
The cylinder temperature isfirst set to a specified value with the cylinder pressure low enough
for all the water to be vapor; then the water is compressed at constant temperature by lowering the
piston until a drop of liquid water appears (i.e., until condensation occurs). The pressure at which
condensation beginsP

noted,  and  the  experiment  is  then  repeated  at  several  progressively  higher  temperatures.  The
following  results  might  be  obtained  (observe  the  pattern  for  the  three  observed  variables  as

6374.15218.3315.5315.5
7>374.15No condensation occurs!
Notice what happens. At 25°C, water condenses at a very low pressure, and the density of the
liquid is more than four orders of magnitude greater than that of the vapor. At higher temperatures,
the  condensation  pressure  increases  and  the  densities  of  the  vapor  and  liquid at  condensation
approach each other. At 374.15°C, the densities of the two phases are virtually equal, and above
that temperature no phase separation is observed, no matter how high the pressure is raised.
In general,the highest temperature at which a species can coexist in two phases (liquid and
vapor) is thecritical temperatureof that species,T
c
,and the corresponding pressure is thecritical
pressure,P
c
. A substance atT
c
andP
c
is said to be at itscritical state. The above experiment
demonstrates and Table B.1 confirms that, for water,T
c

c

The  terms“gas”and“vapor”are  often  used  interchangeably,  but  there  is  a  technical
difference  between them  that you are now  in a position  to understand.  Avaporis a gaseous
species below its critical temperature, and agasis a species above its critical temperature at a
pressure low enough for the species to be more like a vapor than a liquid (i.e., a density closer to
1 g/L than 1000 g/L). You can condense a vapor by compressing it isothermally, but while you can
make a gas denser and denser by compressing, it isothermally you will never achieve a separation
into two phases. Substances at temperatures aboveT

and pressures aboveP

are referred to as
supercriticalfluids.

of state requires a trial-and-error procedure. As illustrated by the next example, a spreadsheet is
ideally suited to solving problems of this type.

obtained by trial and error; for example, the value in Cell C9 would be varied until the value in Cell D9 is
sufficiently  close to zero, and similarly  for Rows 10 and 11. The search is conveniently done using the
spreadsheet’s Goal Seek tool. If you are not experienced in the use of spreadsheets, it might be useful to
construct this one and attempt to reproduce the given results.
Remember  that  the  SRK  equation  of  state  (and  every  other  equation  of state)  is itself  an
approximation. Referring back to the preceding example, a published study provides experimental
data for thePVTbehavior of propane.

All equations of state have parameters obtained byfitting empirical expressions to exper-
imentalPVTdata. Thefit may be excellent in the temperature and pressure ranges where the data
were obtained but poor elsewhere. You should always try to ascertain the region of validity of any
equation of state you intend to use. At conditions far removed from this region, you have no
assurance of the accuracy of the equation.

5.4  The Compressibility-Factor Equation of State235

It would be convenient if the compressibility factor at a single temperature and pressure were the
same for all gases, so that a single chart or table ofzT;Pcould be used for allPVTcalculations. Nature
is not that accommodating, unfortunately; for example,zfor nitrogen at 0°C and 100 atm is 0.9848
whilezfor carbon dioxide at the same temperature and pressure is 0.2020. Consequently, to use
tabulatedzvalues for allPVTcalculations as in the preceding example, you would have to measure
compressibilities  as  functions  of  temperature  and  pressure  separately  for  every  chemical  species.
Equations of state such as the van der Waals and the Soave–Redlich–Kwong equations were developed
to avoid having to compile the massive volumes ofzdata that would be involved in such an effort.
One approach to using the compressibility-factor equation of state would be to determine
zexperimentally as a function ofTandPfor different chemical species and substitute it into
Equation 5.4-2a, 5.4-2b, or 5.4-2c in process calculations. While such tabulations can be found for
some common species, the immense amount of experimental work that would be required to do it
for most species makes that approach impractical.
An alternative method uses thelaw of corresponding statesto estimatez, and then substitutes
zinto the compressibility-factor equation of state. The basis for the law is the observation that the
values of certain physical properties of gases—including the compressibility factor—depend to a
great  extent  on  the  proximity  of  the  gas  temperature  and  pressure  (TandP)  to  the  critical
temperatureT
c
and critical pressureP
c
of the gas species. The law states that the compress-
ibility factor of any gas at a specific value ofreduced temperature, T=T
c
, andreduced pressure,
P=P
c
, has approximately the same value for all species. A singlegeneralized compressibility
chart
7
showingzas  a  function  ofT
r
;P
r
may  therefore  be  prepared  and  used  to  estimate
compressibility factors.
Figure 5.4-1 shows a generalized  compressibility chart for those species having a critical
compressibility factor of 0.27.
8
Conditions for both gases and liquids are illustrated, although in
our discussions here we only consider estimation ofzfor gases. Note the increasing deviations
from ideal-gas behavior as pressures approachP
c
(i.e., whenP
r
!1).
Figures 5.4-2 through 5.4-4 are expansions of various regions of Figure 5.4-1. The parameter
V

r
is  introduced  in  thesefigures  to  eliminate  the  need  for  trial-and-error  calculations  in
problems where either temperature or pressure is unknown. This parameter is defined in terms of
the ideal critical volume

Figure 5.4-1 covers a very wide spectrum of reduced pressures, and it is difficult to read the
value ofzwith much precision in some pressure ranges. Figures 5.4-2, 5.4-3, and 5.4-4 expand the
chart for low, medium, and high reduced pressures, respectively, adding considerable precision in
those ranges. IfP(and thusP
r
) is known, the appropriate chart to use is easy to identify; ifPis to be
determined  from  the  compressibility-factor  equation  of  state  and  known  values  ofT

andV

finding the right chart may be a little harder.
The  procedure  for  using  the  generalized  compressibility  chart  forPVTcalculations  is  as
follows:
1.Determine the critical temperature,T
c
, and critical pressure,P
c
, of the species either by looking it
up [e.g., in Table B.1 or with the APEx functions Tcrit(“Species”) and Pcrit(“Species”)] or using

An extension of the generalized charts that provides somewhat greater accuracy also allows for a dependence ofzT;Pon

4.Use the compressibility charts to determine the compressibility factor, and then solve for the
unknown variable from the compressibility-factor equation of state (Equation 5.4-2).
The compressibility-factor equation of state used in conjunction with the generalized com-
pressibility  chart  is  not  generally  as  accurate  as  a  multiple-constant  equation  of  state  forPVT
calculations under highly nonideal conditions. Furthermore, it lacks precision and cannot readily be
adapted to computer calculations. Its advantages include relative computational simplicity and (as
will be shown) adaptability to multicomponent gas mixtures.

5.4a  Nonideal-Gas Mixtures
Whether  an  analytical  or  graphical  correlation  is  used  to  describe  nonideal-gas  behavior,
difficulties  arise  when  the  gas  contains  more  than  one  species.  Consider,  for  example,  the
SRK equation of state (Equation 5.3-8): How would you estimate the parametersa,b, andαif the
gas  consisted  of  methane,  carbon  dioxide,  and  nitrogen?Mixture rulesdeveloped  for  such
circumstances  are  summarized  by  Poling  et  al.  (see  Footnote  1).  We  will  illustratePVT
calculations  for  mixtures  with  a  simple  rule  developed  by  Kay
10
that  utilizes  the  generalized
compressibility charts.
Kay’s ruleestimatespseudocritical propertiesof  mixtures  as  simple  averages  of  pure-
component critical constants:

Like  the  theory  of  corresponding  states  on  which  it  is  based,  Kay’s  rule  provides  only
approximate values of the quantities it is used to calculate. It works best when used for mixtures of
nonpolar compounds whose critical temperatures and pressures are within a factor of two of one
another. Poling et al. (see Footnote 1) provide more complex but more accurate mixing rules for
systems that do not fall into this category.

5.4  The Compressibility-Factor Equation of State241

5.5  SUMMARY
Problems often arise that call for determining the value of one of
the four variablesP,T,V, andn(or
_
Vand
_
n) for a process material
from known values of the other three.
If  the  material  is  a  solid  or  liquid  and  consists  of  a  single
species, look up the specific gravity or density in Table B.1 or
one  of  the  references  on  p.  216.  As  afirst  approximation,
assume that the tabulated value is independent of temperature
and  pressure.  For  a  more  refined  estimate,find  and  apply  a
correlation for the dependence of the density on temperature.
If the material is a liquid mixture, eitherfind a table of mixture
density as a function of composition or assume volume additivity
and estimate the mixture density from either Equation 5.1-1 or
Equation 5.1-2. If the material is a dilute liquid solution, either
find a table of mixture density as a function of composition or
take the density to be that of the pure solvent.
If the material is a gas, the ideal-gas equation of statePV
nRTmay provide a reasonable approximation forPVTcalcu-
lations. The equation works best at low pressures (on the order
of 1 atm  or  less)  and  high temperatures  (generally  not  much
lower than 0°C). A rule of thumb is that the ideal-gas equation
provides reasonable estimates ifRT=Pis greater than 5 L/mol
for diatomic gases and greater than 20 L/mol for other gases.
Standard temperature and pressure(STP)   are   generally
defined as 0°C and 1 atm. These values and the corresponding
standard specific volume,
^
V
s
22:4LSTP/mol
ww€
359 ft
3
(STP)/lb-mole, can be used in conjunction with Equation 5.2-5
forPVTcalculations on ideal gases.
Thepartial pressureof a component in an ideal-gas mixture is
y
i
P, wherey
i
is the mole fraction of the component andPis the
total absolute pressure. The component partial pressures add up
to the total pressure.
The  volume  percent  of  a  component  in  an  ideal-gas  mixture
(%v/v) is the same as the mole percent of that component. If the
gas mixture is nonideal, the volume percent has no useful meaning.
Thecritical temperature T
c
of a species is the highest tempera-
ture at which isothermal compression of the species vapor results
in  the  formation  of  a  separate  liquid  phase,  and  thecritical
pressureis the pressure at which that phase forms. Isothermal
compression of a species above its critical temperature—agas
(as opposed tovapor)orsupercriticalfluid—results in afluid of
increasing density but not a separate liquid phase.
If process conditions are such that the ideal-gas equation of
state  is  a  poor  approximation,  a  more  complex  species-
specific equation of state must be used. Most such equations,
including theSoave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK)equation of state,
contain  adjustable  parameters  that  depend  on  the  critical
temperature  and  pressure  of  the  species  and  possibly  other
factors that depend on the molecular geometry and polarity of
the species.
An alternative to using quadratic equations of state (such as the
truncated virial equation) and cubic equations of state (such as the
SRK  equation)  is  to  use  thecompressibility-factor equation of
state: PVznRT.  The compressibility factorz,defined as the
ratioP
^
V=RT, equals 1 if the gas behaves ideally. For some species
it may be looked up in a table (e.g., inPerry’s Chemical Engineers’
Handbook)  or,  more  generally,  estimated  from  the  generalized
compressibility charts (Figures 5.4-1 through 5.4-4).
The basis of the generalized compressibility charts is thelaw of
corresponding states, an empirical rule stating that the com-
pressibility  factor  of  a  species  at  a  given  temperature  and
pressure depends primarily on thereduced temperatureand
reduced pressure, T
r
T=T
c
andP
r
P=P
c
. Once you have
determined these quantities, you may use the charts to deter-
minezand  then  substitute the  value  in the  compressibility-
factor  equation  of  state  and  solve  for  whichever  variable  is
unknown.
To performPVTcalculations for non-ideal gas mixtures, you
may useKay’s rule. Determinepseudocritical constants(tem-
perature and pressure) by weighting the critical constants for
each mixture component by the mole fraction of that compo-
nent in the mixture; then calculate the reduced temperature and
pressure and the compressibility factor as before.
Remember that every equation of state for nonideal gases is an
approximation, often based onfitting adjustable parameters to
experimentalPVTdata.  Be  skeptical  of  every  value  you
estimate, especially if you are using an equation of state beyond
the range of conditions for which it was developed.
If aPVTcalculation is part of a material balance problem and a
volume (or volumetricflow rate) is either given or required for
a  process  stream,  label  bothn(or
_
n)  andV(or
_
V)  on  the
flowchart  and  count  a  density  relationship  (for  solids  and
liquids)  or  an  equation  of  state  (for  gases)  as  an  additional
relation in the degree-of-freedom analysis.

5.2.Sulfuric acid is used in the synthesis and processing of countless chemicals and metals and is the
electrolyte in common lead-acid batteries. It is used in various strengths, ranging from concentrated
(100%) to dilute, so being able to estimate its concentration from a simple measurement of specific
gravity is quite useful.
Suppose  you  prepare  a  solution  that  is  30.0 wt%  H
2
SO
4
in  water  and  intend  to  confirm  the
concentration by comparing the specific gravity of the solution to a value obtained from the literature.
You carefully add 30.0 g of H
2
SO
4
to 70.0 g of water (you know that rapidly adding acid to water or
water to concentrated acid can lead to dangerous splatters of liquid) and allow the resulting mixture to
equilibrate at 20°C.
(a)From the specific gravities in Table B.1, estimate the volumes of water and sulfuric acid that have
been blended, and then estimate the density of the 30.0 wt% sulfuric acid solution, assuming the
volumes are additive. Why are the values of pure-component specific gravities different from those
in Example 5.1-1, and what is the effect of these differences on the total volume of the mixture?
(b)Perry’sChemicalEngineers’Handbook(p. 2-112) gives the specific gravity of sulfuric acid as a function
of both acid concentration and temperature. The value for 30.0 wt% sulfuric acid at 20°C is given as
1.2185. Estimate the volume of the 30.0 wt% solution prepared as described by the above process.
(c)What volume of 40.0 wt% sulfuric acid at 25°C(SG1:2991must be added to 100.0 g of the
30.0-wt% solution to produce a solution that is 35.0 wt% sulfuric acid?
5.3.When a liquid or a gas occupies a volume, it may be assumed tofill the volume completely. On the
other hand, when solid particles occupy a volume, there are always spaces (voids) among the particles.
Theporosityorvoid fractionof a bed of particles is the ratio (void volume)/(total bed volume). The
bulk densityof the solids is the ratio (mass of solids)/(total bed volume), and theabsolute densityof
the solids has the usual definition (mass of solids)/(volume of solids).
Suppose 600.0 g of a crushed ore is placed in a graduated cylinder,filling it to the 184 cm
3
level.
One hundred cm
3
of water is then added to the cylinder, whereupon the water level is observed to be at
the 233:5cm
3
mark. Calculate the porosity of the dry particle bed, the bulk density of the ore in this
bed, and the absolute density of the ore.
5.4.The volume of a steady-state crystallizer is 85,000 L, and the solids fraction in the unit and the exiting
stream is 0.35; that is, there are 0.35 kg of crystals per kg of slurry (the crystal-solution mixture). The
density of the solution is 1.1 g/mL and that of the crystals is 2.3 g/mL. The production rate of crystals
from the crystallizer  is 19.5 kg crystals/min.  Estimate  the volumetricflow rate of slurry from the
crystallizer and thedrawdown timeof the crystallizer (the time it would take to empty the crystallizer
if the feed were discontinued).
5.5.Two liquid streams areflowing at constant rates into a mixer. One is benzene, whichflows at a measured
rate of 20.0 L/min, and the other is toluene. The blended mixture enters a storage tankinner diameter

liquid level in the tank is observed to increase by 0.15 meters over a one-hour period. Calculate theflow
rate of toluene into the mixer (L/min) and the composition of the tank contents (wt% benzene).

exposure level(PEL) of 1.0 ppm (part per million on a molar basis, equivalent to a mole fraction of
1:010
6
) averaged over an 8-hour period.
The  safety  engineer  in  a  plant  wishes  to  determine  whether  the  benzene  concentration  in  a
laboratory exceeds the PEL. One Monday at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m., she collects samples of room
air (33°C, 99 kPa) in evacuated 2-liter stainless steel containers. To collect a sample she opens the
container valve, allows room air to enter until the container pressure equals atmospheric pressure, and
then charges clean dry helium into the container until the pressure reaches 500 kPa. Next, she takes the
containers to an analytical laboratory in which the temperature is 23°C, leaves them there for a day,
and then feeds gas from each container to a gas chromatograph (GC) until the pressure in the container
is reduced to 400 kPa. In the order in which they were collected, the samples that pass through the GC
are found to contain 0.656μg (microgram), 0.788μg, and 0.910μg of benzene, respectively.
(a)What were the concentrations of benzene (ppm on a molar basis) in the original room air at the
three collection times? (Assume ideal-gas behavior.) Is the average concentration below the PEL?
(b)Why did the engineer add helium to the container after collecting the room air sample? Why did
she wait a day before analyzing the container contents?
(c)Why might afinding that the average benzene concentration is below the PEL not necessarily
mean  that  the  laboratory  is  safe  insofar  as  exposure  to  benzene  is  concerned?  Give  several
reasons, including possible sources of error in the sampling and analysis procedure. (Among other
things, note the day on which the samples were taken.)

Bread is typically made byfirst dissolving preserved yeast (a microscopic biological organism that
consumes  sugars  and  emits  CO
2
as  a  waste  product)  in  water,  then  adding  other  ingredients,
includingflour,  sugar,  fat  (usually  butter  or  shortening),  and  salt.  After  the  ingredients  are
combined,  the  dough  is“kneaded,”or  mixed  to  promote  the  formation  of  a  protein  network
from two proteins (gliadin and glutenin)
15
present in wheatflour. This network is what strengthens
the dough and allows it to stretch elastically without breaking. The dough is then allowed to rise in
a process called“proofing,”in which the yeast consumes sugar and releases CO

These proteins combine with water to form gluten, which gives the dough elasticity and strength. Approximately 6% of

pockets expand due to the temperature rise and evaporation of water, the starches from theflour are
dehydrated (dried), and the yeast dies.
A good French bread has an open, porous structure. The pores must be stabilized by the protein

investigated the influence of ingredients and mixing conditions on the quality of
frozen French bread dough. Each loaf was initially formed roughly as a cylinder with a mass of
150 g (including essentially no CO

specific volume of a bread dough proofed for two hours at 28°C from which 1:20 cm

100 g dough evolves as bubbles within the dough. State your assumptions.
(b)During proofing, the increases in volume of a series of control loaves were monitored along
with the mass of CO

evolved. Rupture of the protein network during proofing can be detected
when the volume of the dough no longer increases at the same rate as the production of CO
2
from the yeast. Data from one of these experiments are shown in the table below. Plot the
specific volumes of CO
2
(per 100 g dough) and dough as a function of time. If the preferred
proofing time is such that the dough achieves 70% of its total volume before collapse, specify
the proper proofing time for this formula.
(c)The  referenced  study  found  that  the  parameter  with  the  most  significant  influence  on  dough
quality was mixing time, with an extended mixing time producing a stronger protein network.
Why might extended mixing times not be desirable in commercial production of bread?
(d)Suggest causes for the following undesirable bread-baking outcomes: (i) aflat, dense loaf; (ii) an
overly large loaf.
(e)Suggest why the period during which the dough rises is called“proofing.”Remember that yeast is

One dark night Sebastian Goniff, a Noxious engineer who is really a spy for the Rancid Plastics

the operation, Goniff obtains a broken pressure gauge that is stuck at 4.7 atm and substitutes it for the
gauge at the Noxious plant. He adjusts the gas pressure regulator so that the real gauge pressure is
1.8 atm, instructs his associate in thefield via mobile phone to open the Rancid line gradually, and
tells him to hold it when theflowmeter at Noxious reads 400 m

When a human takes a breath, the inhaled airflows through the nostrils and trachea before splitting
into two primary bronchial tubes. The primary tubes further split to form smaller tubes, and eventually
the air passages end in sacs, calledalveoli. In the alveoli, oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged
with the blood. The typical trachea is 2 cm in diameter; the right primary bronchial tube has a diameter
of 12 mm and that of the left is 10.0 mm. The average adult takes 12 breaths per minute, with each
breath taking in about 0.5 L of air at ambient conditions, which may be taken to be 1.0 atm and 25°C.

During your summer vacation, you plan an epic adventure trip to scale Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.
Dehydration is a great danger on such a climb, and it is essential to drink enough water to make up for
the amount you lose by breathing.
(a)During your pre-trip physical, your physician measured the averageflow rate and composition of
the gas you exhaled (expired air) while performing light activity. The results were 11.36 L/min at
body temperature (37°C) and 1 atm, 17.08 mole% oxygen, 3.25% carbon dioxide, 6.12 mole%
H
2
O, and the balance nitrogen. The ambient (inspired) air contained 1.67 mole% water and a
negligible amount of carbon dioxide. Calculate the rate of mass lost through the breathing process
(kg/day) and the volume of water in liters you would have to drink per day just to replace the water
lost in respiration. Consider your lungs to be a continuous steady-state system, with input streams
being inspired air and water and CO
2
transferred from the blood and output streams being expired
air and O
2
transferred to the blood. Assume no nitrogen is transferred to or from the blood.
(b)You made the trip to Tanzania and completed the climb to Uhuru Peak, the summit of Kilimanjaro, at
an altitude of 5895 meters above sea level. The ambient temperature and pressure there averaged
9:4°C and 360 mm Hg, and the air contained 0.46 mole% water. The molarflow rate of your
expired air was roughly the same as it had been at sea level, and the expired air contained 14.86% O
2
,
3.80% CO
2
, and 13.20% H
2
O. Calculate the rate of mass lost (g/day) through breathing and water
you would have to drink (L/day) just to replace the water lost in respiration.
(c)The equality of the molarflow rates of expired air at sea level and at Uhuru Peak is due to a
cancellation of effects, one of which would tend to increase the rate at higher altitudes and the
other to decrease it. What are those effects? (Hint:Use the ideal-gas equation of state in your
solution, and think about how the oxygen concentration at a high altitude would likely affect your
breathing rate.)

5.41.Phosgene (CCl
2
O) is a colorless gas that was used as an agent of chemical warfare in World War I. It
has the odor of new-mown hay (which is a good warning if you know the smell of new-mown hay).
Pete Brouillette, an innovative chemical engineering student, came up with what he believed was
an effective new process that utilized phosgene as a starting material. He immediately set up a reactor
and  a  system  for  analyzing  the  reaction  mixture  with  a  gas  chromatograph.  To  calibrate  the
chromatograph (i.e., to determine its response to a known quantity of phosgene), he evacuated a
15.0 cm length of tubing with an outside diameter of 0.635 cm and a wall thickness of 0.559 mm, and
then connected the tube to the outlet valve of a cylinder containing pure phosgene. The idea was to
crack  the  valve,fill  the  tube  with  phosgene,  close  the  valve,  feed  the  tube  contents  into  the
chromatograph, and observe the instrument response.
What Pete hadn’t thought about (among other things) was that the phosgene was stored in the
cylinder at a pressure high enough for it to be a liquid. When he opened the cylinder valve, the liquid
rapidlyflowed into the tube andfilled it. Now he was stuck with a tube full of liquid phosgene at a
pressure the tube was not designed to support. Within a minute he was reminded of a tractor ride his
father had once given him through a hayfield, and he knew that the phosgene was leaking. He quickly
ran out of the lab, called campus security, and told them that a toxic leak had occurred, that the
building had to be evacuated, and the tube removed and disposed of properly. Personnel in air masks
shortly appeared, took care of the problem, and then began an investigation that is still continuing.
(a)Show why one of the reasons phosgene was an effective weapon is that it would collect in low
spots soldiers often mistakenly entered for protection.
(b)Pete’s  intention  was  to  let  the  tube  equilibrate  at  room  temperature  (23°C)  and  atmospheric
pressure. How many gram-moles of phosgene would have been contained in the sample fed to the
chromatograph if his plan had worked?
(c)The laboratory in which Pete was working had a volume of 2200 ft
3
, the specific gravity of liquid
phosgene is 1.37, and Pete had read somewhere that the maximum“safe”concentration of phosgene
in  air  is  0.1 ppm  (0:110
6
mol  CCl
2
O/mol  air).  Would  the“safe”concentration  have  been
exceeded if all the liquid phosgene in the tube had evaporated into the room? Even if the limit would
not have been exceeded, give several reasons why the lab would still have been unsafe.
(d)List several things Pete did (or failed to do) that made his experiment unnecessarily hazardous.

5.43.A distillation column is being used to separate methanol and water at atmospheric pressure. The
column temperature varies from approximately 65°Catthetopto100°C at the bottom. Liquid enters
the top of the column andflows down to the bottom; vapor is generated in a reboiler at the bottom of
the column,flows upward, and leaves at the top. The molarflow rate of vapor up the column may be
assumed to be constant from top to bottom. The vapor velocity is kept below 5.0 ft/s to keep the
vapor from entraining liquid (suspending and carrying away liquid droplets).
(a)Where in the column is the greatest risk of liquid entrainment? Explain your answer.
(b)Assuming that the liquidflowing down the column and the column internals (equipment inside
the  column)  occupy  a  negligible  fraction  of  the  column  cross-sectional  area,  estimate  the
minimum column diameter if the vaporflow rate is 25.0 lb-mole/min.
(c)Suppose the column is constructed with a diameter 10% greater than that determined in Part (b).
What are the vapor velocities at the top and bottom of the column if the vapor molarflow rate in
both locations is 25.0 lb-mole/min? How much can the vapor molarflow rate be increased without
causing liquid entrainment?
(d)There is a need to increase process throughput, which would require the vapor molarflow rate to
be doubled. It has been suggested that increasing the pressure in the column would allow that to be
done without risking excessive liquid entrainment. Again applying a vapor velocity limit of 5 ft/s,
what would the new pressure be?

In a continuous fermentation process, ethanol enters the top of the fermenter at a rate of 145 kg/h, and
the air fed to the bottom of the fermenter is 25% in excess of the amount required to consume all of the
ethanol. A gas stream containing nitrogen and unreacted oxygen leaves the top of the fermenter, and a
liquid  stream  containing  acetic  acid,  water,  and  10%  of  the  entering  ethanol  leaves  the  bottom.
Assume that none of the ethanol, water, and acetic acid in the reactor is vaporized. The fermenter

S and 90.0% CO

The  gases  leave  the  reactor  at  10:0m

behavior, determine the feed rate of air in kmol/min. Provide a single balanced chemical equation
reflecting the overall process stoichiometry. How much sulfur is produced in kg/min?
5.66.The  quantity  of  sulfuric  acid  used  globally  places  it  among  the  most  plentiful  of  all  commodity
chemicals. In the modern chemical industry, synthesis of most sulfuric acid utilizes elemental sulfur
as a feedstock. However, an alternative and historically important source of sulfuric acid was the
conversion of an ore containing iron pyrites (FeS
2
) to sulfur oxides by roasting (burning) the ore with
air. The following reactions occurred in an oven:

The gases leaving the oven were fed to a catalytic converter in which most of the remaining SO
2
produced was oxidized to SO
3
. Finally, the gas leaving the converter was sent to an absorption column
where the SO
3
was taken up by water to produce sulfuric acid (H
2
SO
4
).
(a)The ore fed to the oven was 90.0 wt% FeS
2
, and the remaining material may be considered inert.
Dry air was fed to the oven in 30.0% excess of the amount required to oxidize all of the sulfur in
the ore to SO
3
. Eighty-five percent of the FeS
2
was oxidized, and 60% of the SO
2
produced was
oxidized to SO
3
. Leaving the roaster were (i) a gas stream containing SO
2
,SO
3
,O
2
, and N
2
and
(ii) a solid stream containing unconverted pyrites, ferric oxide (Fe
2

), and the inert material.
Calculate the required feed rate of air in standard cubic meters per 100 kg of ore fed to the process.
Also determine the molar composition and volume (SCM/100 kg ore) of the gas leaving the oven.
(b)The gas leaving the oven entered the catalytic converter, which operated at 1.0 atm. Reaction
(2) proceeded to equilibrium, at which point the component partial pressures are related by
the expression

The gases werefirst heated to 600°C to accelerate the rate of reaction, and then cooled to 400°Cto
enhance SO

P
at these two temperatures is 9:53 atm

and 397 atm

, respectively. Calculate the equilibrium fractional conversions of SO
2
at these two
temperatures.
(c)Estimate the production rate of sulfuric acid in kg/kg ore if all of the SO
3
leaving the converter was
transformed to sulfuric acid. What would this value be if all the sulfur in the ore had been converted?
Exploratory Exercises—Research and Discover
(d)Two of the important factors affecting the utility of a chemical reaction are the maximum extent of
the reaction and the rate at which the reaction occurs. Consider these two factors and explain the
steps in the converter in which the gas was heatedfirst and then cooled.
(e)Why has elemental sulfur come to be the dominant feedstock in sulfuric acid manufacturing?
5.67.A  small  power  plant  produces  500 MW  of  electricity  through  combustion  of  coal  that  has  the
following composition on a dry basis: 76.2 wt% carbon, 5.6% hydrogen, 3.5% sulfur, 7.5% oxygen,
and the remainder ash. The coal contains 4.0 wt% water. The feed rate of coal is 183 tons/h, and it is
burned with 15% excess air at 1 atm, 80°F, and 30.0% relative humidity.

Part (b)], recalculate the molarflow rate and composition of the effluent from the furnace.
(d)The gas leaving the furnace passes through an electrostatic precipitator, where particulates from

What is the gas velocity at a point in the stack where the stack diameter is 25 ft and the temperature

A fresh feed of pure liquid PX combines with a recycle stream containing PX and a solution (S) of a
catalyst (a cobalt salt) in a solvent (methanol). The combined stream, which contains S and PX in a 3:1
mass ratio, is fed to a reactor in which 90% of the PX is converted to TPA. A stream of air at 25°C and
6.0 atm absolute is also fed to the reactor. The air bubbles through the liquid and the reaction given
above  takes  place  under  the  influence  of  the  catalyst.  A  liquid  stream  containing  unreacted  PX,
dissolved TPA, and all the S that entered the reactor goes to a separator in which solid TPA crystals
are formed andfiltered out of the solution. Thefiltrate, which contains all the S and PX leaving the
reactor, is the recycle stream. A gas stream containing unreacted oxygen, nitrogen, and the water
formed in the reaction leaves the reactor at 105°C and 5.5 atm absolute and goes through a condenser
in which essentially all the water is condensed. The uncondensed gas contains 4.0 mole% O

(d)What is the massflow rate (kg/h) of the recycle stream?
(e)Briefly explain in your own words the functions of the oxygen, nitrogen, catalyst, and solvent in
the process.
(f)In the actual process, the liquid condensate stream contains both water and PX. Speculate on what
might be done with the latter stream to improve the economics of the process. [Hint:Note that PX
is expensive, and recall what is said about oil (hydrocarbons) and water.]
5.73.Steam reformingis an important technology for converting refined natural gas, which we take here to

5.82.An innovative engineer has invented a device to replace the hydraulic jacks found at many service
stations. A movable piston with a diameter of 0.15 m isfitted into a cylinder. Cars are raised by
opening a small door near the base of the cylinder, inserting a block of dry ice (solid CO
2
), closing and
sealing the door, and vaporizing the dry ice by applying just enough heat to raise the cylinder contents
to ambient temperature (25°C). The car is subsequently lowered by opening a valve and venting the
cylinder gas.
The device is tested by raising a car a vertical distance of 1.5 m. The combined mass of the piston
and the car is 5500 kg. Before the piston rises, the cylinder contains 0:030 m

An oxygen tank with a volume of 2:5ft

gas equation of state to determine that if the tank isfirst evacuated and then charged with 35:3lb
m
of
pure oxygen, its ratedmaximum allowable working pressure(MAWP) will be attained. Operation at
pressures above this value is considered unsafe.
(a)What is the maximum allowable working pressure (psig) of the tank?
(b)You suspect that at the conditions of the fully charged tank, ideal-gas behavior may not be a good
assumption. Use the SRK equation of state to obtaina better estimate of the maximum mass of oxygen
that may be charged into the tank. Did the ideal-gas assumption lead to a conservative estimate (on the
safe side) or a nonconservative estimate of the amount of oxygen that could be charged?
(c)Suppose the tank is charged and ruptures before the amount of oxygen calculated in Part (b) enters
it. (It should have been able to withstand pressures up to four times the MAWP.) Think of at least
five possible explanations for the failure of the tank below its rated pressure limit.
5.84.Using the SRK equation of state (or any other cubic equation of state) to determine a specific volume from
aspecified  temperature  and  pressure  requires  a  trial-and-error  calculation.  Three  computer-based
approaches to solving this problem may be used: (1) spreadsheet programs such as Excel’s Solver;
(2) mathematical packages such as Mathcad, Mathematica, Matlab, and Polymath; and (3) programming

You are on a summer internship with a gas supplier planning to transport hydrogen to service

In ametered-dose inhaler(MDI), such as those used for asthma medication, medicine is delivered by
a compressed-gas propellant. (The device is similar in concept to a can of spray paint.) When the
inhaler is activated, afixed amount of the medicine suspended in the propellant is expelled from the
mouthpiece and inhaled. In the past, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were used as propellants; however,
because  of  their  reactivity  with  the  Earth’s  ozone  layer,  they  have  been  replaced  by  hydrofluor-
ocarbons (HFCs), which do not react with ozone.
In one brand of inhalers, the original CFC propellant has been replaced by HFC 227ea (C

HF

,
heptafluoropropane).  The  volume  of  the  inhaler  propellant  reservoir  is  1:0010
2
mL,  and  the
propellant is charged into the reservoir to a gauge pressure of 4.443 atm at 23°C. An online search for
properties  of  HFC  227ea  yields  the  information  that  the  critical  temperature  and  pressure  of  the
substance are 374.83K and 28.74 atm, and the acentric factor isω0:180.
(a)Assuming ideal-gas behavior, estimate the mass(g) of propellant in the fully charged inhaler.
(b)Someone  in  the  manufacturer’s  Quality  Control  Division  has  raised  a  concern  that  assuming
ideal-gas behavior might be inaccurate at the charging pressure. Use the SRK equation of state to
recalculate the moles of propellant at the specified conditions. What percentage error resulted
from using the ideal-gas assumption?
5.92.The concentration of oxygen in a 5000-liter tank containing air at 1 atm is to be reduced by pressure
purging prior to charging a fuel into the tank. The tank is charged with nitrogen up to a high pressure

required to bring the oxygen concentration below 10 ppm (i.e., to bring the mole fraction of O
2
below
10:010
6
). Assume that the temperature is 25°C at the beginning and end of each charging cycle.
When doingPVTcalculations in Parts (b) and (c), use the generalized compressibility chart if
possible for the fully charged tank and assume that the tank contains pure nitrogen.
(a)Speculate on why the tank is being purged.
(b)Estimate the gauge pressure (atm) to which the tank must be charged if the purge is to be done in
one charge–vent cycle. Then estimate the mass of nitrogen (kg) used in the process. (For this part,
if you can’tfind the tank condition on the compressibility chart, assume ideal-gas behavior and
state whether the resulting estimate of the pressure is too high or too low.)
(c)Suppose nitrogen at 700 kPa gauge is used for the charging. Calculate the number of charge–vent
cycles required and the total mass of nitrogen used.
(d)Use your results to explain why multiple cycles at a lower gas pressure are preferable to a single

phase-change operationson  a  single  species,  such  as  freezing,  melting,  evaporation,  and
condensation, and mostseparationandpurificationprocesses, which are designed to separate
components of mixtures from one another. Most separations are accomplished by feeding a
mixture of species A and B into a two-phase system under conditions such that most of the A
remains in its original phase and most of the B transfers into a second phase. The two phases
then either separate themselves under the influence of gravity—as when gases and liquids or
two immiscible liquids separate—or are separated with the aid of a device such as afilter or a
skimmer.
Here are some examples of multiphase separation processes.
Brewing a cup of coffee.Hot  liquid  water  and  solid  ground  coffee  beans  are  contacted.
Soluble  constituents  of  the  beans  are  transferred  from  the  solid  phase  to  a  liquid  solution
(coffee), and then the residual solids (grounds) arefiltered from the solution. The operation of
dissolving a component of a solid phase in a liquid solvent is referred to asleaching.
Removal of sulfur dioxide from a gas stream.If a fuel that contains sulfur is burned, the
product gas contains sulfur dioxide. If the gas is released directly into the atmosphere, the SO
2
combines with atmospheric oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. The SO
3
in turn combines with
water vapor in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid (H
2
SO
4
), which eventually precipitates as
acid rain. To prevent this occurrence, the combustion product gas is contacted with a liquid
solution in anabsorptionorscrubbingprocess. The SO
2
dissolves in the solvent and the clean
gas that remains is released to the atmosphere.
Recovery of methanol from an aqueous solution.After being used as a reactant or solvent,
methanol (methyl alcohol) often leaves a process in an aqueous mixture (combined with water).
Methanol has a highervapor pressurethan water, meaning that it has a greater tendency to
vaporize  when  a  mixture  of  the  two  species  is  heated.  The  separation  processdistillation
exploits this difference by partially vaporizing a liquid mixture, yielding a vapor relatively rich
in methanol and a residual liquid relatively rich in water. Subsequent partial condensations and
vaporizations can be used to recover almost pure methanol. The recovered methanol can be
recycled and reused, resulting in considerable savings in raw material costs.
Separation of paraffinic and aromatic hydrocarbons.Liquid paraffinic hydrocarbons (such
as  pentane,  hexane,  and  heptane)  and  liquid  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (such  as  benzene,
toluene, and  xylene)  have different  chemical  characteristics;  for  example,  the  paraffinic
compounds are almost completely immisciblewith liquid ethylene glycol, while aromatic
compounds and ethylene glycol readily form homogeneous liquid mixtures. Paraffinics and
aromatics may therefore be separated from each other by blending a mixture of the two with
ethylene  glycol.  When  allowed  to  settle,  thearomatic  compounds  distribute  between  a
paraffin-rich  phase  and  a  glycol  phase.  This  process  is  known  asliquid extraction.
Subsequent processing separates the aromatics from the glycol, recovering the glycol for
recycle and reuse in the extraction process.

Para-xylene (p-xylene) is separated from its two isomers and used as a raw material in the
synthesis ofp-teraphthalic acid, which in turn is used in the production of several important
polymers. Since the three isomers have similar volatilities, their separation by distillation is
difficult and uneconomical.
Two alternative commercial operations have been developed to perform the separation. In
one, a mixture of the isomers is contacted with amolecular sievethat has pores large enough to
accommodatepara-xylene but not themetaororthoisomers. This operation is referred to as
adsorption. In another process, the difference in freezing points of the three isomers (para-
xylene  freezes  at  13.3°C,orthoat25:2°C,  andmetaat47:9°C)  forms  the  basis  of  a
crystallizationoperation. The mixture is cooled to a temperature at whichparacrystallizes and
can then be separated physically from the remainingorthoandmetaliquid.
When a species transfers from one phase to another, the transfer rate generally decreases with
time until the second phase issaturatedwith the species, holding as much as it can at the prevailing
process conditions. When the concentrations of all species in each phase no longer change with time,
the phases are said to be inphase equilibrium. The effectiveness of any of the separation processes
described above depends both on how species are distributed between the phases at equilibrium and
on the rate at which the system approaches equilibrium from its initial state.

6.1SINGLE-COMPONENT PHASE EQUILIBRIUM
6.1a  Phase Diagrams
At most temperatures and pressures, a single pure substance at equilibrium exists entirely as a
solid, liquid, or gas; but at certain temperatures and pressures, two and even all three phases may
coexist. Pure water is a gas at 130°C and 100 mm Hg, for example, and a solid at40°C and
10 atm, but at 100°C and 1 atm it may be a gas, a liquid, or a mixture of both, and at approximately
0.0098°C and 4.58 mm Hg it may be a solid, a liquid, a gas, or any combination of the three.
Aphase diagramof a pure substance is a plot of one system variable against another that shows
the conditions at which the substance exists as a solid, a liquid, and a gas. The most common of these
diagrams  plots  pressure  on  the  vertical  axis  versus  temperature  on  the  horizontal  axis.  The
boundaries between the single-phase regions represent the pressures and temperatures at which
two phases may coexist. The phase diagrams of water and carbon dioxide are shown in Figure 6.1-1.
What the phase diagram means and what can be done with it are illustrated by a hypothetical
experiment in which pure water is placed in a leakproof evacuated cylinderfitted with a movable
piston,  as  shown  in  the  diagram  on  the  next  page.  Heat  can  be  added  to  or  withdrawn  from
the cylinder, so that the temperature in the chamber can be adjusted to any desired value, and the
276CHAPTER 6Multiphase Systems

absolute pressure of the cylinder contents [which equalsFW=A, whereWis the weight of the
piston] can similarly be adjusted by varying the forceFon the piston.
F = force on piston
A = area of piston

Suppose the system is initially at 20°C, and the force is set at a value such that the system
pressure  is  3 mm  Hg.  As  the  phase  diagram  shows,  water  can  only  exist  as  a  vapor  at  these
conditions, so any liquid that may initially have been in the chamber evaporates, untilfinally the
chamber contains only water vapor at 20°C and 3 mm Hg (point A on Figure 6.1-1a).
Now suppose the force on the piston is slowly increased with the system temperature held
constant at 20°C until the pressure in the cylinder reaches 760 mm Hg, and thereafter heat is added
to the system with the pressure remaining constant until the temperature reaches 130°C. The state
of the water throughout this process can be determined by following path A!B!C!D!E
on  Figure  6.1-1a.  The  conditions  of  the  system  at  various  stages  of  the  process  are  shown

Notice that the phase transitions—condensation at point B and evaporation at point D—take place

As you can see from Figure 6.1-1a, the freezing point of water decreases with increasing
pressure. (Verify.) This behavior is extremely unusual; most substances, including carbon dioxide,
exhibit the opposite behavior. Note also, however, that the changes are very slight; the solid–liquid
equilibrium curves are in fact nearly vertical. Their slopes have been exaggerated in Figure 6.1-1
for illustrative purposes.
Normal boiling and melting points for many substances are given in Table B.1 of Appendix

6.1b  Estimation of Vapor Pressures
Thevolatilityof a species is the tendency of the species to transfer from the liquid (or solid) state
to the vapor state. At a given temperature and pressure, a highly volatile substance is much more
likely to be found as a vapor than is a substance with low volatility, which is more likely to be
found in a condensed phase (liquid or solid).
Separation processes including partial vaporization, partial condensation, and distillation are
used to separate mixtures according to the relative volatilities of their components. For example,
if a liquid mixture is partially vaporized, the products are a vapor rich in more volatile species and
a  liquid  rich  in  less  volatile  species.  The  vapor  pressure  of  a  species  reflects  its  volatility:
generally, the higher the vapor pressure at a given temperature, the greater the volatility of the
species at that temperature.
It often happens that tabulated vapor pressures are not available at temperatures of interest, or
they may not be available at all for a given species. One solution to this problem is to measurep
*
at
the  desired  temperatures.  Doing  so  is  not  always  convenient,  however,  especially  if  a  highly
precise value is not required. An alternative is toestimatethe vapor pressure using an empirical

CREATIVITY EXERCISE

pressure of a substance at a given temperature. (Example:You want to know whether you can

6.2THE GIBBS PHASE RULE
When two phases are brought into contact with each other, a redistribution of the components of
each phase normally takes place—species evaporate, condense, dissolve, or solidify until a state of
phase equilibrium is reached in which the temperatures and pressures of both phases are the same
and the composition of each phase no longer changes with time.
Suppose  you  have  a  closed  vessel  containing  three  components  A,  B,  and  C  distributed
between gas and liquid phases, and you wish to describe this system to someone else in sufficient
detail for that person to duplicate it exactly. Specifying the system temperature and pressure, the
masses of each phase, and two mass or mole fractions for each phase would certainly be sufficient;
however, these variables are not all independent—once some of them are specified, others are
fixed by nature and, in some cases, may be calculated from physical properties of the system
components.
The  variables  that  describe  the  condition  of  a  process  system  fall  into  two categories:
extensive variables, which depend on the size of the system, andintensive variables,which
do  not.  Mass  and  volume  are  examples  of  extensive  variables;  intensive  variables  include
temperature, pressure, density and specific volume, and mass and mole fractions of individual
system components in each phase.
The  number  of  intensive  variables  that  can  be  specified  independently  for  a  system  at
equilibrium is called thedegrees of freedomof the system. Let

[Note: Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see Footnote 1), p. 4-27, presents a proof of the
phase rule and outlines a method for determining how many independent reactions may occur
among the components of a system.]
The meaning of the termdegrees of freedomin the Gibbs phase rule is similar to its meaning
in the degree-of-freedom analyses you have been performing since Chapter 4. In those analyses,
the degrees of freedom represents the number of process variables that must be specified for a
process system before the remaining variables can be calculated. In the Gibbs phase rule, the
degrees of freedom equals the number ofintensivevariables that must be specified for a systemat
equilibriumbefore the remaining intensive variables can be calculated.
The example that follows illustrates the application of the Gibbs phase rule to several simple
systems.  The  remainder  of  the  chapter  presents  the  equilibrium  relationships  that  are  used  to
determine the remaining intensive system variables once the allowed number of these variables
has been specified.

6.3GAS–LIQUID SYSTEMS: ONE CONDENSABLE COMPONENT
Systems containing several components, of which only one is capable of existing as a liquid at the
process conditions, are common in industrial processes. Operations such asevaporation, drying,
andhumidification—all of which involve transfer of liquid into the gas phase—andcondensa-
tionanddehumidification, which involve transfer of the condensable species from the gas to the
liquid phase, are examples of such processes.
Suppose liquid water is introduced into a chamber that initially contains dry air and that the
temperature and pressure in the system are kept constant at 75°C and 760 mm Hg. Initially the gas
phase contains no waterp
H

mole fraction of water in the gas phase,y
H

O
, increases, and hence so does the partial pressure of
water,p
H

O
y
H

P. Eventually, however, the amount of water in the gas phase is such that the
rate at which water molecules enter the gas phase approaches zero, and thereafter no change occurs
in the amount or composition of either phase. The gas phase is then said to besaturatedwith
water—it contains all the water it can hold at the system temperature and pressure—and the water
in the gas phase is referred to as asaturated vapor.
Let us apply the Gibbs phase rule to this equilibrium system. Since there are two phases and
two components,
DF2cΠ2
It follows that only two out of the three intensive variablesT,P, andy
H

O
can be specified, and that
some relationship must exist that uniquely determines the value of the third variable once thefirst
two have been specified.

A law  that describes the  behavior  of gas–liquid systems  over a wide range  of conditions
provides the desired relationship.If a gas at temperature T and pressure P contains a saturated
vapor whose mole fraction is y
i
(mol vapor/mol total gas), and if this vapor is the only species that
would condense if the temperature were slightly lowered, then the partial pressure of the vapor in
the gas equals the pure-component vapor pressure p

Equation 6.3-1 is a limiting case ofRaoult’s law, which will be introduced in a more general
context in Section 6.4. It is the fundamental relation used in the analysis of equilibrated gas–liquid
systems containing one condensable component. A wide variety of problems occur in connection
with such systems, but they all eventually involve knowing two of the variablesy
i
,P, andTand
having to determine the third using Equation 6.3-1.
Example 6.3-1Composition of a Saturated Gas–Vapor System
Air and liquid water are contained at equilibrium in a closed chamber at 75°C and 760 mm Hg. Calculate the
molar composition of the gas phase.
3
It could be argued that setting the mole fraction of air in the liquid water to zero uses up a degree of freedom. In fact,
however, we are notfixing a precise value of this variable; all we are saying is that the mole fraction of air in the liquid water
approaches zero and the value is so small that it does not affect liquid-phase behavior and mass balances on the system.
284CHAPTER 6Multiphase Systems

Several important points concerning the behavior of gas–liquid systems and several terms
used to describe the state of such systems are summarized here.
1.A gas in equilibrium with a liquid must be saturated with the volatile components of that liquid.
2.The partial pressure of a vapor at equilibrium in agas mixture containing a single condensable
component cannot exceed the vapor pressure of the pure component at the system temperature. If
p
i
p
∗
i
, the vapor is saturated; any attempt to increasep
i
—either by adding more vapor to the gas
phase or by increasing the total pressure at constant temperature—must instead lead to condensation.
3.A vapor present in a gas in less than its saturation amount is referred to as asuperheated vapor.

(6.3-2)
Since  only  a  saturated  vapor  can  condense  (why?),  condensation  in  a  system  containing  a
superheated vapor requires changing one or more of the variables of Equation 6.3-2 so that the
inequality becomes the equality of Raoult’s law. This can be done in several ways, such as by
increasing the pressure at constant temperature (the left side increases, while the right side stays
constant) or by decreasing the temperature at constant pressure (the left side remains constant,
and the right side decreases).
4.If a gas containing a single superheated vapor is cooled at constant pressure, the temperature at
which the vapor becomes saturated is referred to as thedew pointof the gas. From Raoult’s law

6.4MULTICOMPONENT GAS–LIQUID SYSTEMS
Gas–liquid  processes  that  involve  several  components  in  each  phase  include  many  chemical
reactions, distillation, and transfer of one or more species from a gas to a liquid (absorptionor
scrubbing) or vice versa (stripping).
When multicomponent gas and liquid phases are in equilibrium, a limited number of intensive
system variables may be specified arbitrarily (the number is given by the Gibbs phase rule), and
the remaining variables can then be determined using equilibrium relationships for the distribution
of components between the two phases. In this section we define several such relationships and
illustrate how they are used in the solution of material balance problems.
6.4a  Vapor–Liquid Equilibrium Data
The  best  way  to  evaluate  equilibrium  compositions  is  from  tabulated  data.Perry’sChemical
Engineers’Handbook(see Footnote 1), pp. 2-80 through 2-94, gives partial pressures of vapors
over various liquid solutions. Example 6.4-1 illustrates the use of such data.
Example 6.4-1Absorption of SO
2
Sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) is produced when coal is burned in power plants. Prior to implementation of clean-air
standards, SO
2
emissions were responsible for acid rain, but utilization of absorbers (sometimes referred to
asscrubbers) to remove SO
2
from combustion products has significantly reduced the problem.
In a simple implementation of that emission-control strategy, a gas mixture containing 45 mole% SO
2
and the balance air (an SO
2
concentration much higher than values normally encountered in power-plant
emissions)flowing at a rate of 100 lb-mole/h is contacted with liquid water in a continuous absorber. The
liquid leaving the absorber is analyzed and found to contain 2.00 g of SO
2
per 100 g of H
2
O. Assuming that
the gas and liquid streams leaving the absorber are in equilibrium at 30°C and 1 atm, calculate the fraction of
the entering SO
2
absorbed in the water and the required water feed rate.

6.4b  Raoult’s Law and Henry’s Law
If you apply the Gibbs phase rule to a multicomponent gas–liquid system at equilibrium, you will
discover that  the  compositions  of the  two phases  at a  given  temperature and  pressure  are  not
independent. Once the composition of one of the phases is specified (in terms of mole fractions,
mass fractions, concentrations, or, for the vapor phase, partial pressures), the composition of the
other phase isfixed and, in principle, can be determined from physical properties of the system
components.
Relationships governing the distribution of a substance between equilibrated gas and liquid
phases are the subject matter ofphase-equilibrium thermodynamicsand, for the most part, fall
beyond the scope of this text. However, we will cover several simple approximate relationships
that often provide reasonably accurate results. Such relationships form the bases of more precise
methods that must be used when system conditions require them.
Suppose A is a substance contained in a gas–liquid system in equilibrium at temperatureT
and pressureP. Two simple expressions—Raoult’s lawandHenry’s law—provide relationships
betweenp
A
, the partial pressure of A in the gas phase, andx
A
, the mole fraction of A in the liquid
phase.

wherep

the gas phase.
Raoult’s law is an approximation that is generally valid when x
A
is close to 1—that is,
when  the  liquid  is  almost  pure  A.  It  is  also  sometimes  valid  over  the  entire  range  of
compositions for mixtures of similar substances, such as paraffinic hydrocarbons of similar
molecular weights.
Note:Whenx

provided thatAdoes not dissociate, ionize, or react in the liquid phase. The law is often applied to
292CHAPTER 6Multiphase Systems

solutions of noncondensable gases. Values of Henry’s law constants (or closely related quantities)
are given for several gases in water on pp. 2-130 through 2-133 ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’
Handbook(see Footnote 1).
A gas–liquid system in which the vapor–liquid equilibrium relationship for every volatile
species is either Raoult’s law or Henry’s law is said to exhibitideal-solutionbehavior. In such
systems the ideal-gas equation of state describes the gas phase.

5.After a cold bottle of soda (CO

bubbles slowly form and emerge. Explain why, using Henry’s law in your explanation.
Example 6.4-2Raoult’s Law and Henry’s Law
Use either Raoult’s law or Henry’s law (whichever is most appropriate) to solve the following problems.
1.A gas containing 1.00 mole% ethane is in contact with water at 25.0°C and 20.0 atm. Estimate the
mole fraction of dissolved ethane.
2.An  equimolar  liquid  mixture  of  benzene  (B)  and  toluene  (T)  is  in  equilibrium  with  its  vapor  at
30.0°C. What is the system pressure and the composition of the vapor?
Solution1.Hydrocarbons normally are relatively insoluble in water, so that the solution of ethane is probably extremely
dilute. Let us therefore apply Henry’s law. Page 2-130 ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see
Footnote 1) gives the Henry’s law constant for ethane in water at 25°Cas2:6710

6.4c  Vapor–Liquid Equilibrium Calculations for Solutions
That Obey Raoult’s Law
Suppose heat is added slowly to a closed vessel that contains a liquid and that the pressure in the
vessel is held constant. We have already examined what happens in a situation of this sort if the
liquid is a single species: the temperature increases until the boiling point of the liquid is reached,
and thereafter the liquid vaporizes at a constant temperature. Once the vaporization is complete,
further addition of heat raises the temperature of the vapor.
Consider now what happens if the liquid is a mixture of several components. As heat is added,
the liquid temperature rises until a temperature is reached at which thefirst bubble of vapor forms.
Up to this point, the process looks like that for a single component. However, if the liquid is a
mixture, the vapor generated generally will have a composition different from that of the liquid.As
vaporization proceeds, the composition of the remaining liquid continuously changes, and hence
so does its vaporization temperature. A similar phenomenon occurs if  a mixture of vapors  is
subjected to a condensation process at constant pressure: at some temperature thefirst droplet of
liquid forms, and thereafter the composition of the vapor and the condensation temperature both
change.
To design or control an evaporation or condensation process, you must know the conditions at
which the transition from liquid to vapor or vapor to liquid takes place. Design or control of other
separation processes such as distillation, absorption, and stripping also requires information on the
conditions at which phase transitions occur and on the compositions of the resulting phases. This
section outlines the required calculations for a relatively simple class of mixtures.
When a liquid is heated slowly at constant pressure, the temperature at which thefirst vapor
bubble forms is thebubble-point temperatureof the liquid at the given pressure. When a gas
(vapor) is cooled slowly at constant pressure, the temperature at which thefirst liquid droplet
forms is thedew-point temperatureat the given pressure. Calculating bubble-point and dew-
point temperatures can be a complex task for an arbitrary mixture of components. However, if the
liquid behaves as anideal solution(one for  which  Raoult’s or Henry’s law is obeyed for  all
components)  and  the  gas  phase  can  also  be  considered  ideal,  the  calculations  are  relatively
straightforward.

formation of a vapor phase. If we assume the vapor is in equilibrium with the liquid, and that the
vapor is ideal (follows the ideal-gas equation of state), the partial pressures of the components are
given by Raoult’s law, Equation 6.4-1.

The  pressure  at  which  thefirst  vapor  forms  when  a  liquid  is  decompressed  at  a  constant

component) and B—is determined at afixed pressureP, and several values of liquid-phase mole
fraction,x
A
and  the  equilibrium  vapor  mole  fraction,y
A
are  determined  for  each  liquid
composition.  This  information  can  be  graphed  in  aTxydiagram,  a  plot  of  the  equilibrium
temperature versus the mole fraction of A, with curves being drawn for both the liquid phase
(Tversusx
A
) and the vapor phase (Tversusy
A
). A plot of this type is shown in Figure 6.4-1afor
the benzene-toluene system atP1 atm. A similar procedure that plots equilibrium pressure vs.
mole fractions results in aPxydiagram(Figure 6.4-1b).
Once you have aTxydiagram like that of Figure 6.4-1a, bubble- and dew-point calculations
become trivial. To determine a bubble-point temperature for a given liquid composition, go to the
liquid curve on theTxydiagram for the system pressure and read the desired temperature from the
ordinate scale. (If you are not sure why this works, go back and consider again how the curve was
generated.) You can then move horizontally to the vapor curve to determine the composition of the
vapor in equilibrium with the given liquid at that temperature.
The dew point of a vapor mixture of A and B atPcan be determined from theTxydiagram if
there are no species other than A and B in the gas phase. Look up the specified mole fraction of A
in the vapor phase, read the dew-point temperature from the corresponding ordinate value of the
vapor curve, and move horizontally to the liquid curve and down to read the composition of the
liquid in equilibrium with the  vapor. If a noncondensable  species is present in the gas phase,
however, you must use Equation 6.4-6 tofind the dew point, as in the previous example.
What  happens  as  a  liquid  mixture  is  continuously  vaporized  is  easily  seen  from  theTxy
diagram. Consider the benzene–toluene system again, and suppose heat is added to a 55 mole%
benzene and 45 mole% toluene liquid mixture at afixed pressure of 1 atm. As Figure 6.4-1ashows,
the  mixture  will  begin  to  boil  at  90°C,  and  the  vapor  generated  will  contain  77%  benzene.
However, once a small amount of liquid has been vaporized, the remainder no longer contains

55%  benzene;  it  contains  less,  since  the  vapor  produced  is  relatively  rich  in  this  component.
Consequently, the temperature of the system steadily rises as more and more liquid is vaporized,
and the compositions of both phases change continuously during the process.
Example 6.4-4Bubble- and Dew-Point Calculations UsingTxyDiagrams
1.Using theTxydiagram, estimate the bubble-point temperature and the equilibrium vapor composition
associated with a 40 mole% benzene–60 mole% toluene liquid mixture at 1 atm. If the mixture is steadily
vaporized until the remaining liquid contains 25% benzene, what is thefinal temperature?
2.Using  theTxydiagram,  estimate  the  dew-point  temperature  and  the  equilibrium  liquid  composition
associated  with  a  vapor  mixture  of  benzene  and  toluene  containing  40  mole%  benzene  at  1 atm.  If
condensation proceeds until the remaining vapor contains 60% benzene, what is thefinal temperature?

Note:The precision associated withTxyandPxydiagrams is less than that of numerical calculations, as
reflected in this example by the use of the. However, the ease of following the process path makes the
diagrams quite useful.
The  term“boiling”is  sometimes  incorrectly  used  to  describe  any  process  involving  the
transition from liquid to vapor. In fact, boiling refers to a specific type of vaporization process in
which vapor bubbles form at a heated surface and escape from the liquid; it doesnotrefer to
molecular evaporation of liquid from a gas–liquid interface, which may occur at temperatures
below the boiling point. (Recall your experience with leaving a container of liquid open to the
atmosphere andfinding the liquid partially or completely evaporated on your return.)
In our discussion of single-component systems, we considered the case of a liquid being heated in
a container exposed to the atmosphere and observed that the liquid boils at a temperature at which the
vapor  pressure  of  the  liquid  equals  the  total  pressure  of  the  atmosphere  above  it.  A  similar
phenomenon occurs for liquid mixtures. If a mixture is heated slowly in an open container, vapor
bubbles will form at the heated surface and emerge into the gas phase when the vapor pressure of the
liquid equals the pressure above the liquid.
6
Some reflection should convince you that the temperature
at which this occurs is the bubble point of the liquid at that pressure. For a liquid mixture that follows
Raoult’s law, the boiling point may therefore be determinedapproximatelyfrom Equation 6.4-9.

Example 6.4-5Boiling Point of a Mixture
A mixture that is 70 mole% benzene and 30 mole% toluene is to be distilled in a batch distillation column. The
column startup procedure calls for charging the reboiler at the base of the column and slowly adding heat until
boiling begins. Estimate the temperature at which boiling begins and the initial composition of the vapor
generated, assuming the system pressure is 760 mm Hg.
SolutionFrom  theTxydiagram,  the  mixture  will  boil  at  approximately
87°C  .  The  initial  vapor  composition  is
approximately
88 mole%benzene and 12 mole%toluene  .
6
This is only an approximation, albeit generally a good one. In fact, the vapor pressure must be slightly greater than the gas-
phase pressure to overcome the effects of liquid surface tension and the hydrostatic head of liquid at the heated surface.

We  conclude  this  discussion  with  onefinal  reminder.  The  vapor–liquid  equilibrium
calculations we have shown in Section 6.4c arebasedontheideal-solutionassumptionand
the  corresponding  use  of  Raoult’s  law.  Many  commercially  important  systems  involve
nonideal solutions, or systems of immiscible orpartially miscible liquids, for which Raoult’s
law is inapplicable and theTxydiagram looks nothing like the one shown for benzene and
toluene. Calculations for systems of this sort are considered in texts on phase-equilibrium
thermodynamics.

6.5SOLUTIONS OF SOLIDS IN LIQUIDS
6.5a Solubility and Saturation
Thesolubilityof a solid in a liquid is the maximum amount of that substance that can be dissolved
in a specified amount of the liquid at equilibrium. This physical property varies considerably from
one solute–solvent pair to another: for example, 100 g of water at 20°C can dissolve 222 g of
AgNO
3
,  0.003 g  of  AgCO
3
,  and  0.00002 g  of  AgBr.  The  limit  may  also  depend  strongly  on
temperature: the solubility of AgNO
3
in 100 g of water increases from 222 g at 20°Cto952gat
100°C.Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see Footnote 1) on pp. 2-7 through 2-47 and
2-126 through 2-129 gives the solubilities of many substances in water, ethyl alcohol, and diethyl
ether at specified temperatures.
A solution that contains as much of a dissolved species as it canat equilibriumis said to be
saturatedwith that species.A solution in equilibrium with solid solute must be saturated with that
solute; if it were not, more solute would dissolve.
If a saturated solution is cooled, the solubility of the solute generally (but not always) decreases;
in order for the cooled solution to return to equilibrium, some solute must come out of solution as
solid. The rate at which solid comes out of solution may be slow, however, so that a metastable
condition can exist in which the concentration of the solute is higher than the equilibrium value at the
solution temperature. Under such conditions, the solution is said to besupersaturated, and the
difference between actual and equilibrium concentrations is referred to assupersaturation. All
problems involving solid–liquid separations in this text assume that equilibrium exists between the
solid and liquid phases, so that supersaturation need not be considered.

One hundredfifty kilograms of a saturated aqueous solution of AgNO
3
at 100°C is cooled to 20°C, thereby
forming AgNO

crystals, which arefiltered from the remaining solution. The wetfilter cake, which contains
80.0% solid crystals and 20.0% saturated solution by mass, is sent to a dryer in which the remaining water is
vaporized. Calculate the fraction of the AgNO

6.5b Solid Solubilities and Hydrated Salts
The Gibbs phase rule shows that specifying temperature and pressure for a two-component system
at equilibrium containing a solid solute and a liquid solution determines the values of all other
intensive variables. (Verify this statement.) Furthermore, because the properties of liquids and
solids are only slightly affected by pressure, a single plot of solubility (an intensive variable)
versus temperature may be applicable over a wide pressure range.
The  solubility  plots  shown  in  Figure  6.5-1  illustrate  how  the  effect  of  temperature  on
solubility can vary from system to system. Increasing the temperature from 0°C to 100°C barely
changes NaCl solubility but increases the solubility of KNO

by more than a factor of 10. For

6.5c  Colligative Solution Properties
Physical properties of a solution generally differ from the same properties of the pure solvent.
Under certain conditions, the changes in the values of several properties—such as vapor pressure,
boiling point, and freezing point—depend only on the concentration of solute in the solution, and
not on what the solute and solvent are. Such properties are referred to ascolligative solution
properties. (A fourth colligative property—osmotic pressure—will not concern us in this text.)
An understanding of colligative properties is important in the determination of the operating
conditions of certain processes. For example, a process can be designed to recover pure water by
evaporation or freezing of seawater. In thefirst instance, pure water is recovered by condensation
of vapor from the evaporator, while in the second it is recovered by separating and melting ice
from the freezer. An engineer who intends to design or operate an evaporator or an ice crystallizer
clearly must know the temperature at which the phase transition takes place—the boiling point in
thefirst case, the freezing point in the second. In addition, measured values of colligative solution
properties are often used to deduce properties of either the solvent or the solute, such as molecular
weight, which cannot easily be determined by more direct means.
This  section  presents  an  introductory  view  of  colligative  properties,  considering  only  the
simple case of a solution in which the solute is nonvolatile (i.e., has a negligible vapor pressure at
the solution temperature) and the dissolved solute neither dissociates (which rules out ionizing
acids, bases, and salts) nor reacts with the solvent. Discussions of more complex systems can be
found in most physical chemistry texts.
Consider a solution in which the solute mole fraction isxand the vapor pressure of the pure
solvent at the solution temperature isp

If the liquid is pure solventx0, this equation predicts that the partial pressure of the solvent
vapor equals the vapor pressure of the solvent, as we would expect. Since the solute is nonvolatile,
the solvent is the only component of the liquid solution that is also in the vapor. The pressure
exerted by this vapor is commonly referred to as theeffectivesolvent vapor pressure:

The simplicity and generality of Equation 6.5-3 are surprising. According to the equation, if a
solution contains 20 mole% solute, then the solvent partial pressure is 80% of the vapor pressure of pure
solvent at the system temperature, regardless of the temperature, the pressure,and what the solute and
solvent are.  (Hence,  vapor  pressure  lowering  is  a  colligative  property,  by  definition.)  The  only
stipulations are that Raoult’s law holds and the solute is nonvolatile, nonreactive, and nondissociative.
304CHAPTER 6Multiphase Systems

The lowering of solvent vapor pressure has two important consequences.The solvent in a
solution at a given pressure boils at a higher temperature and freezes at a lower temperature than
does the pure solvent at the same pressure.  The  validity  of  these  statements  can  be  seen  by
referring to Figure 6.5-2, a phase diagram for an arbitrary solute–solvent system. Shown on this
figure are the vapor–liquid and solid–liquid equilibrium curves for a pure solvent (solid curves)
and for a solution of afixed solute concentration (dashed curves). The solution vapor–liquid and
solid–liquid equilibrium curves lie below the solvent curves, reflecting the fact that the effective
vapor pressure at a given temperature and freezing point at a given pressure for the solution are
lower  than  those  of  the  pure  solvent.  The  higher  the  solute  concentration,  the  greater  is  the
separation between the pure solvent and the solution curves.
The effect of the solute on the solution boiling point is easy to see from the diagram. Recall
that the boiling point of a liquid at a given pressure is the intersection of a horizontal line at that
pressure  with  the  vapor–liquid  equilibrium  curve.  At  pressureP
0
,  the  pure  solvent  boils  at
temperatureT
b0
, while the solution boils at a higher temperature,T
bs
.
The  change  in  the  solvent freezing  point  is a  little  less  obvious.  First,  consider the  triple
point—the intersection of the solid–vapor and the liquid–vapor equilibrium curves. It is clear from
Figure 6.5-2 that the effect of the vapor pressure lowering is to lower the triple point of the solution
relative to pure solvent. If in addition the solid–liquid equilibrium curve for the solution is (like
that for the pure solvent) almost vertical, then the freezing point at an arbitrary pressureP

also
drops—on the diagram, fromT

for the pure solvent toT

for the solution.
Since we know how the solution vapor pressure varies with concentration (the relationship
being  given  by  Equation  6.5-2)  and  temperature  (through  the  Clausius–Clapeyron  equation,
Equation 6.1-3), we can determine the relationships between concentration and both boiling point
elevation  and  freezing  point  depression.  The  relationships  are  particularly  simple  for  dilute
solutions (x!0, wherexis solute mole fraction).

physical significance is discussed in Chapter 8. The derivation of Equation 6.5-4 is dealt with in
Problem 6.95 at the end of this chapter.
Since  the  coefficients  ofxin  these  two  equations  are  constant,  it  follows  that  for  dilute
solutions of nonvolatile, nonreactive, nondissociative solutes, both boiling point elevation and
freezing point depression vary linearly with solute mole fraction.

of a vapor pressure and phase-transition temperatures for a known solution concentration, and to
the calculation of a solution composition and solute molecular weight from a measured colligative
property.

6.6EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN TWO LIQUID PHASES
6.6a  Miscibility and Distribution Coefficients
If  water  and  methyl  isobutyl  ketone  (MIBK)  are  mixed  at  25°C,  a  single  phase  results  if  the
mixture contains more than either 98% water or 97.7% MIBK by mass; otherwise, the mixture
separates into two liquid phases, one of which contains 98% H
2
O and 2% MIBK and the other
97.7% MIBK and 2.3% H
2
O. Water and MIBK are examples ofpartially miscibleliquids; they
would be termedimmiscibleif one phase contained a negligible amount of water and the other a
negligible amount of MIBK.
If a third substance is added to a two-phase liquid mixture, it distributes itself according to its relative
solubility in each phase. For example, acetone is soluble in both water and chloroform—two nearly
immiscible liquids—but much more so in chloroform. If a mixture of acetone and water is contacted with
chloroform, a substantial portion of the acetone enters the chloroform-rich phase. Therefore, a partial
separation of  the acetone from  water may be accomplished by allowing the mixture to settle and
separating the two phases. This exampleillustrates the separation process ofliquid extraction.
Suppose A and S are two nearly immiscible liquids and B is a solute distributed between the
phases  of  an  A–S  mixture.  Thedistribution coefficient(also  known  aspartition ratio)of
component B is the ratio of the mass fraction of B in the S phase to that in the A phase.Perry’s
Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see Footnote 1) on pp. 15-29 through 15-31 lists distribution
coefficients for a number of ternary (three-component) liquid systems. Example 6.6-1 illustrates
the use of this physical property in a material balance calculation.
Example 6.6-1Extraction of Acetone from Water
Two hundred cubic centimeters of an acetone–water mixture that contains 10.0 wt% acetone is mixed with
400.0 cm

of chloroform at 25°C, and the phases are then allowed to settle. What percentage of the acetone is
transferred from the water to the chloroform?

Let us next assume that chloroform and water are immiscible. (How to deal with partial miscibility is discussed in
Section 6.6b.) In drawing theflowchart for this problem, it is advisable to label the quantities of each component
in each of the two output streams, rather than the total stream masses and component mass fractions. (Labeling in
the latter manner results in having to solve four simultaneous equations in four unknowns.)

In practice, extraction is often carried out in several consecutive stages, with the solution

chapter illustrates this method of operation.

6.6  Equilibrium Between Two Liquid Phases309

The latter is easier to construct on rectangular axes, but the two forms are equally easy to use.
In both cases, each apex of the triangle represents a single component and edges represent
binary  solutions.  For  example,  edgebon  Figure  6.6-1  represents  solutions  of  H

acetone.  PointKrepresents  a  mixture  that  is  20.0 wt%  MIBK,  65.0%  acetone,  and  15.0%
water. Any mixture whose composition falls in regionA, such as at pointK, is a single-phase
liquid, whereas any mixture whoseoverallcomposition falls in regionBseparates into two
phases.
The  lines  shown  within  regionB—calledtie lines—connect  compositions  of  the  two
liquid phases in equilibrium with each other. For example, if MIBK, water, and acetone are
blended so that a mixture with overall composition at pointM(55.0 wt% water, 15.0% acetone,
30.0% MIBK) results, the mixture separates intophases having compositions given by points
L(85 wt% water, 12% acetone, 3% MIBK) andN(4 wt% water, 20% acetone, 76% MIBK).
When a  mixture  does  not  fall  on a  tie  line,  interpolation  between the  lines  is  necessary  to
determine the composition of each phase.
The Gibbs phase rule demonstrates that a mixture of three components that forms two liquid
phases at equilibrium has three degrees of freedom. (Verify.) If pressure (which generally has little
effect on liquid properties) and temperature arefixed, one degree of freedom remains. Specifying
the mole fraction of one of the components in one of the phases is therefore sufficient to determine
the compositions of both phases. For example (referring to Figure 6.6-1), specifying that the
weight fraction of acetone is 0.25 in the MIBK-rich phasefixes both the composition of that phase
and  the  composition  of  the  water-rich  phase.  (Verify  this  statement  by  determining  both
compositions.)

6.7ADSORPTION ON SOLID SURFACES
The attraction of chemical species in gases and liquids to the surfaces of solids is the basis of a
number  of  separation  processes.  For  example,  baking  soda  or  charcoal  may  be  placed  in  a
refrigerator  to  remove  unacceptable  odors,  and  compressed  air  may  be  dried  and  purified  by
passing it through a bed of calcium chloride to remove water vapor and then through a bed of
activated carbon to separate hydrocarbons taken up by the air during compression. Each of these
operations utilizes a solid with an extremely high surface area (e.g., about 800 m
2
/g of activated
carbon)
7
and takes advantage of the affinity of specific components in afluid for the surface of a
solid. The solid is known as anadsorbentand the component attracted to the solid surface is an
adsorbate.
Adsorbate equilibrium data on a specific adsorbent are often taken at a specific temperature
and are referred to asadsorption isotherms. These functions or plots relateX

Draw  a  vacuum  in  the  chamber  and  then  admit  carbon  tetrachloride  vapor  until  a  desired

More activated carbon than this would be put into the container, for several reasons. First, since the rate of
adsorption approaches zero as the adsorbent approaches saturation, it would take an infinite amount of time
for the mole fraction of CCl
4
in the gas phase to reach 0.001. If more carbon is present, the target mole fraction
would be reached in afinite amount of time (before the carbon becomes saturated). Second, the Langmuir
isotherm is an approximate correlation with parameters obtained byfitting scattered experimental data, and so
the estimated adsorption capacity of the adsorbentX
*
could be too high. Third, we have assumed that
nothing but CCl
4
is adsorbed on the carbon. If any oxygen, nitrogen, or other species that may be present in
the gas is adsorbed, it could lower the amount of carbon tetrachloride adsorbed.
6.7  Adsorption on Solid Surfaces313

In this section we have assumed that the adsorption isotherm of an adsorbate is unaffected by
the  presence  of  constituents  other  than  the  adsorbate  in  thefluid  mixture.  If  such  ideality  is
assumed for the Langmuir isotherm developed in the previous example, you could use the derived
expression for any gaseous system containing carbon tetrachloride and the same activated carbon.
In reality, however, the presence of other solutes that have an affinity for the carbon surface alters
the CCl
4
equilibrium behavior. An accurate system representation would require data or models
for the complete multicomponent mixture.

6.8  SUMMARY
Two phases in contact with each other are said to be inequilibrium
when the temperature, pressure,  composition, and all other var-
iables that characterize each phase do not change with time. Many
chemical  process  operations—particularly  separation  processes
such as distillation, absorption, crystallization, liquid extraction,
and   adsorption—work   by   distributing   mixture   components
between two phases and then separating the phases. An essential
step  in  analyzing  such  processes  is  determining  how  the  feed
mixture components distribute themselves between the two phases
at equilibrium. This chapter summarizes common procedures for
making this determination.
Thephase diagramof  a  pure  species  is  a  plot  of  pressure
versus temperature that shows regions where the species exists
as a solid, a liquid, or a gas; curves that bound these regions
where pairs of phases can coexist in equilibrium; and a point
(thetriple point) where all three phases can coexist.
The temperature coordinate of a point on the vapor–liquid equi-
librium curve (the curve separating the liquid and vapor regions on
a  phase  diagram)  is  theboiling pointof  the  species  at  the
corresponding pressure, and the pressure coordinate is thevapor
pressureof  the  species  at  the  corresponding  temperature.  The
normal boiling pointis the boiling point atP1atm. Normal
boiling points (and normal melting points) of selected species can
be found in Table B.1 or calculated using the AntoineT function of
APEx. Vapor pressures at specified temperatures can be estimated
using the Antoine equation (Table B.4), the AntoineP function of
APEx, or Table B.3 for water.
The vapor pressure of a species is a measure of itsvolatility,
or tendency to vaporize. Heating a liquid mixture tends to
form a vapor enriched in more volatile components (those
with higher vapor pressures) and to leave the residual liquid
enriched in components with lower volatility. The separation
processdistillationis based on this principle. Similarly, if a
gas mixture contains one or more components with relatively
low volatilities, cooling the mixture in acondensationoper-
ation  can  be  used  to  recover  a  liquid  enriched  in  these
components.
TheGibbs phase rulegives  thedegrees of freedomof  a
multiphase system in equilibrium, or the number of intensive
(size-independent)  system  variables  that  must  be  specified
before the others can be determined.

either the temperature is decreased or the pressure is increased,
A will begin to condense. If liquid A is in contact with a gas
phase and the system is at equilibrium, the A vapor in the gas
must be saturated.
If a gas containing a single superheated vapor A is cooled at
constant pressure, the temperature at which the vapor becomes
saturated is thedew pointof the gas. The dew point may be
determined from Raoult’s law,y

If you are given the temperature, pressure, and either the dew

related quantity (molal or absolute or percentage saturation),
you can use Raoult’s law to calculate the mole fraction of A in
the gas.

Anideal liquid solutionis one for which all volatile compo-
nents are distributed between liquid and gas phases at equili-
brium according to either Raoult’s law or Henry’s law.
Thebubble-point temperatureof  a  liquid  mixture  is  the
temperature  at  which  thefirst  vapor  bubble  forms  if  the
mixture  is  heated  at  constant  pressure.  Contrary  to  what
many  students  mistakenly  assume,  the  bubble  point  isnot
the  boiling  temperature  of  the  most  volatile  species  in  the
liquid; it is always higher than this temperature for an ideal
liquid  solution.  Thedew-point temperatureof  a  vapor
mixture is the temperature at which thefirst liquid droplet
forms if the mixture is cooled at constant pressure. If Raoult’s
law applies to all species, either of these temperatures can be
determined by trial and error using Equation 6.4-4 (for the
bubble point) or Equation 6.4-7 (for the dew point).
If a liquid mixture is heated above its bubble point, the vapor
generated is rich in the more volatile mixture components. As
vaporization   continues,   the   system   temperature   steadily
increases (unlike the case for a single-component system, in
whichTremains constant). Similarly, if a vapor mixture is
cooled below its dew point, the liquid that condenses is rich in
the  less  volatile  components  and  the  temperature  progres-
sively decreases.
Thesolubilityof a solid (thesolute)inaliquid(thesolvent)is
the  maximum  amount  of  that  solute  that  can  dissolve  in  a
specified amount of the liquid at equilibrium. A solution that
contains all the dissolved solute it can hold issaturatedwith
that solute. If additional solute is added, it will not dissolve
unless the temperature is changed in a way that increases the
solubility.
In  the  separation  processcrystallization,  a  solution  of  a
solute  is  cooled  below  its  saturation  temperature,  causing
solid crystals of solute to form; alternatively, solvent may be
evaporated  to  cause  solute  crystallization.  For  aqueous
solutions  of  some  solutes  in  certain  temperature  ranges,
the crystals that form arehydrated salts, containingwater
of hydrationmolecules  bonded  to  solute  molecules  in
specific ratios. For example, if magnesium sulfate crystal-
lizes  at  a  temperature  above  100°C,  the  crystals  contain
anhydrous(water-free) MgSO
4
, while if the crystallization
takes place between 48°Cand67°C, the crystals consist of
MgSO
4
6H
2
O (magnesium sulfate hexahydrate).
Provided that the solute in a solution is nonvolatile and does not
react with the solvent, the vapor pressure of the solution at a
given temperature is lower than that of the pure solvent, the
boiling  point  at  a  given  pressure  is  higher,  and  the  freezing
point at  a given  pressure  is  lower. Vapor  pressure lowering,
boiling  point  elevation,  and  freezing  point  depression  are
examples  ofcolligative solution properties;  formulas  for
them are given in Section 6.5c.
Liquid extractionis a separation process in which a liquid
feed  solution  is  combined  with  a  second  solvent  that  is
immiscible  or  nearly  immiscible  with  the  feed  solvent,
causing  some  (and  ideally  most)  of  the  solute  to  transfer
to the phase containing the second solvent. Thedistribution
coefficientis the ratio of the solute mass fractions in the two
phases at equilibrium. Its value determines how much sol-
vent must be added to the feed solution to achieve a specified
solute transfer. When the two solvents are partially miscible,
atriangular phase diagramlike that in Figure 6.6-1 sim-
plifies balance calculations on extraction processes.
Adsorptionis a process in which a species in afluid (liquid
or gas) mixture adheres to the surface of a solid with which
thefluid is in contact. (This process should not be confused
withabsorption,  in  which  a  component  of  a  gas  mixture
dissolves in a liquid solvent.) The solid is theadsorbent,
and the species that adheres to the surface is theadsorbate.
Good adsorbents such as activated carbon have extremely
high  specific  surface  areas  (m
2
surface/g  solid),  enabling
small quantities of adsorbentto remove large quantities of
adsorbate fromfluid mixtures. Anadsorption isothermis a
plot or equation that relates the equilibrium amount of an
adsorbate held by a given mass of adsorbent to the adsorbate
partial pressure or concentration in the surrounding gas at a
specified temperature.
Material balance calculations on separation processes follow
the same procedures used in Chapters 4 and 5. If the product
streams leaving a unit include two phases in equilibrium, an
equilibrium relationship for each species distributed between
6.8  Summary315

the  phases  should  be  counted  in  the  degree-of-freedom
analysis  and  included  in  the  calculations.  If  a  species  is
distributed between gas and liquid phases (as in distillation,
absorption,  and  condensation),  use  tabulated  vapor–liquid
equilibrium  data,  Raoult’s  law,  or  Henry’slaw.Ifasolid
solute is in equilibrium with a liquid solution, use tabulated
solubility  data.  If  a  solute  is  distributed  between  two
immiscible   liquid   phases,   use   a   tabulated   distribution
coefficient or equilibrium data. If an adsorbate is distributed
between a solid surface and a gas phase, use an adsorption
isotherm.

6.9.When aflammable liquid (e.g., gasoline) ignites, the substance actually burning is vapor generated
from the liquid. If the concentration of the vapor in the air above the liquid exceeds a certain level (the
lowerflammability limit), the vapor will ignite if it is exposed to a spark or another ignition source.
Once ignited, the heat released is likely to cause additional vaporization of the liquid, and the resulting
fire may continue until all combustible material has been consumed.

gives off sufficient vapor to form an ignitable mixture with air near the surface of the liquid or within

flash point ofn-octane at 1.0 atm is 13°C(55°F), which means that dropping a match into an open
container of octane is likely to start afire in a laboratory, but not outside on a cold winter day. (Do not
try it! One reference—L. Bretherick,Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards,4th
Edition, Butterworths, London, 1990, p. 1596—points out there is“usually afair[our emphasis]

from ambient conditions (31°C, 70% relative humidity). The collected condensate serves as the source
of water for lawn maintenance. Estimate (a) the rate of intake of air at ambient conditions in cubic feet
per minute and (b) the hours of operation required tofill the cistern.
6.16.Air containing 20.0 mole% water vapor at an initial pressure of 1 atm absolute is cooled in a 1-liter

6.17.Air at 90°C and 1.00 atm (absolute) contains 10.0 mole% water. A continuous stream of this air enters
a compressor–condenser, in which the temperature is lowered to 15.6°C and the pressure is raised to
3.00 atm. The air leaving the condenser is then heated isobarically to 100°C. Calculate the fraction of
water that is condensed from the air, the relative humidity of the air at 100°C, and the ratio (m

6.18.When fermentation units are operated with high aeration rates, significant amounts of water can be
evaporated into the air passing through the fermentation broth. Since fermentation can be adversely
affected if water loss is significant, the air is humidified before being fed to the fermenter. Sterilized
ambient air is combined with steam to form a saturated air–water mixture at 1 atm and 90°C. The
mixture is cooled to the temperature of the fermenter (35°C), condensing some of the water, and the
saturated air is fed to the bottom of the fermenter. For an airflow rate to the fermenter of 10 L/min at
35°C and 1 atm, estimate the rate at which steam must be added to the sterilized air and the rate
(kg/min) at which condensate is collected upon cooling the air–steam mixture.

ANODE
The cell consists of two gas channels separated by a membrane sandwiched between twoflat carbon-
paper electrodes—the anode and the cathode—that contain imbedded platinum particles. Hydrogen
flows into the anode chamber and contacts the anode, where H
2
molecules are catalyzed by the platinum
to dissociate and ionize to form hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons. The electrons are conducted
through the carbonfibers of the anode to an external circuit, where they pass to the cathode of the next cell
in the stack. The hydrogen ions permeate from the anode through the membrane to the cathode.
Humid air is fed into the cathode chamber, and at the cathode O
2
molecules are catalytically split to
form  oxygen  atoms,  which  combine  with  the  hydrogen  ions  coming  through  the  membrane  and
electrons coming from the external circuit to form water. The water desorbs into the cathode gas and is
carried out of the cell. The membrane material is a hydrophilic polymer that absorbs water molecules and
facilitates the transport of the hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode. Electrons come from the
anode of the cell at one end of the stack andflow through an external circuit to drive the device that the
fuel cell is powering, while the electrons coming from the deviceflow back to the cathode at the opposite
end of the stack to complete the circuit.
It is important to keep the water content of the cathode gas between upper and lower limits. If the
content reaches a value for which the relative humidity would exceed 100%, condensation occurs at
the cathode (flooding), and the entering oxygen must diffuse through a liquid waterfilm before it can
react. The rate of this diffusion is much lower than the rate of diffusion through the gasfilm normally
adjacent to the cathode, and so the performance of the fuel cell deteriorates. On the other hand, if there
is not enough water in the cathode gas (less than 85% relative humidity), the membrane dries out and
cannot transport hydrogen efficiently, which also leads to reduced performance.
A 400-cell 300-volt PEMFC operates at steady state with a power output of 36 kW. The air fed to
the cathode side is at 20.0°C and roughly 1.0 atm (absolute) with a relative humidity of 70.0% and a

6.21.A storage tank for liquidn-octane has a diameter of 30 ft and a height of 20 ft. During a typical 24-h
period the level of liquid octane falls from 18 ft to 8 ft, after which fresh octane is pumped into the tank
to return the level to 18 ft. As the level in the tank falls, nitrogen is fed into the free space to maintain
the  pressure  at  16 psia;  when  the  tank  is  being  refilled,  the  pressure  is  maintained  at  16 psia  by
discharging gas from the vapor space to the environment. The nitrogen in the tank may be considered
saturated with octane vapor at all times. The average tank temperature is 90°F.
(a)What is the daily rate, in gallons and lb

(b)What is the variation in absolute pressure at the bottom of the tank in inches of mercury?
(c)How much octane is lost to the environment during a 24-h period?

(c)To  what  temperature  (°C)  would  the  gas  have  to  be  cooled  at  constant  pressure  in  order  to
condense 80% of the hexane?
6.24.Recovery  and  processing  of  various  oils  are  important  elements  of  the  agricultural  and  food
industries. For example, soybean hulls are removed from the beans, which are thenflaked and
contacted with hexane. The hexane extracts soybeanoil and leaves very little oil in the residual
solids.  The  solids  are  dried  at  an  elevated  temperature,  and  the  dried  solids  are  used  to  feed
livestock or further processed to extract soy protein. The gas stream leaving the dryer is at 80°C,
1 atm absolute, and 50% relative saturation.
(a)To  recover  hexane,  the  gas  leaving  the  dryer  is  fed  to  a  condenser,  which  operates  at  1  atm

is recovered at a rate of 1.50 kmol/min.

(b)In  an  alternative  arrangement,  the  gas  leaving  the  dryer  is  compressed  to  10.0 atm  and  the

6.25.A 20,000-liter storage tank was taken out of service to repair and reattach a feed line damaged in a
collision with a tanker. The tank was drained and then opened several days later for a welder to enter
and perform the required work. No one realized, however, that 5 liters of liquid nonane (C
9
H
20
)
remained in a collection sump at the bottom of the tank after the draining had been completed.
(a)Nonane has a lower explosive limit of 0.80 mole% and an upper explosive limit of 2.9 mole%
8
(i.e., nonane–air mixtures at 1 atm can explode when exposed to a spark orflame if the nonane
mole fraction is between the two given values). Assume any liquid nonane that evaporates spreads
uniformly throughout the tank. Is it possible for the average gas-phase composition in the tank to
be within the explosive limits at any time? Even when the average composition falls outside those
limits, why is an explosion still a possibility? (Hint:Think about that assumption.)
(b)Use the Antoine equation (6.1-4) to estimate the temperature at which the system would have to
equilibrate in order for the gas in the tank to be at the lower explosive limit.
(c)Fortunately,  a  safety  inspector  examined  the  system  before  the  welder  began  work  and
immediately canceled the work order. The welder was cited andfined for violating established
safety procedures. One requirement was for the tank to be purged thoroughly with steam after
being drained. What is the purpose of this requirement? (Why purge, and why with steam rather
than air?) What other precautions should be taken to be sure that the welder is in no danger?
6.26.An adult inhales approximately 12 times per minute, taking in about 500 mL of air with each inhalation.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs, but there is essentially no exchange of nitrogen.
The exhaled air has a mole fraction of nitrogen of 0.75 and is saturated with water vapor at body
temperature, 37°C. If ambient conditions are 25°C, 1 atm, and 50% relative humidity, what volume of
liquid water (mL) would have to be consumed over a two-hour period to replace the water loss from
breathing?  How  much  would  have  to  be  consumed  if  the  person  is  on  an  airplane  where  the
temperature, pressure, and relative humidity are respectively 25°C, 1 atm, and 10%?
6.27.Recovering and reusing organic solvents is an important part of the operation of most chemical plants.
The magnitude of these recovery efforts can be staggering: e.g., in recent years Eastman Chemical
Company used 4.0 billion pounds of solvents annually and recovered 3.96 billion pounds (99%).
Eastman’s installation of a $26 million (in 1990 dollars) acetone-recovery system reduced acetone
emissions by 50% in the division that had been responsible for most of these emissions.
9
A gas stream containing 20.0 mole% acetone and the remainder nitrogen leaves a chemical plant
at  90°C  and  1 atm.  In  an  acetone-recovery  process,  stream  is  cooled  at  constant  pressure  in  a
condenser,  enabling  some  of  the  acetone  vapor  to  be  recovered  as  a  liquid.  The  nitrogen  and
uncondensed acetone are discharged to the atmosphere.
(a)Give two major benefits of recovering the acetone.
(b)Two coolingfluids are available—cooling-tower water at 20°C and a refrigerant at35°C. For
eachfluid, calculate the percentage acetone recovery [(mol acetone condensed/mol acetone fed to
condenser)100%], assuming that the condenser temperature equals the coolant temperature.
(c)What more would you need to know to decide which coolant to use?
(d)In a real system, the condenser temperature could never be as low as the initial coolingfluid
temperature. Why not? (Hint:In a condenser, heat is transferred from the processfluid to the
coolingfluid.) Explain how this fact would affect the percentage solvent recovery.

6.30.The air in a building is to be maintained at 25°C and 55% relative humidity by passing outside air
through a water spray. The air enters the spray chamber at 32°C and 70% relative humidity, leaves the
chamber  cooled  and  saturated  with  water  vapor,  and  is  then  reheated  to  25°C.  Estimate  the

6.31.Ahygrometeris used to measure the moisture content of humid air. Calibration of the instrument

Room air is charged into the hygrometer sample chamber on a day when the temperature is 22°C,
barometric pressure is 1.00 atm, and the relative humidity is 40%. The resulting meter reading is
H5:0. A second measurement is then made by heating water to 50°C in a sealedflask containing
air. The system is allowed to equilibrate at a pressure of 839 mm Hg with liquid still present in the
flask, and a sample of the air above the liquid is withdrawn and injected into the sample chamber
(which is heated to prevent condensation). The meter reading in this case isH48.

(b)Suppose you wish to condition air at 35°C and 1 atm to produce air at 22°C, 1 atm, and 40%

water, and then reheats the remaining air to 22°C. A sample of the outside air is injected into the
hygrometer chamber, and the resulting reading isH30. Calculate the temperature to which
the air must be cooled before it is reheated and determine the amount of water condensed in
kg/m

6.32.Recovery of a solvent vapor from a gas stream by condensation can be achieved by cooling the gas,

O. The design called for
drawing atmospheric air at 90% relative humidity, 25°C, 760 mm Hg into a blower that forces the
air through a heater and into the dryer. When the operation was put into service, weather conditions
were exactly as assumed in the design, and measurements showed that the air leaving the dryer was
at 80°C and a gauge pressure of 10 mm Hg. However, there was no way to check the operation of
the blower to see if it was delivering the specified volumetricflow rate of air. Your boss wants to
check that value and asks you to devise a method for doing so. You go back to your office, sketch
the process, and determine that you can estimate the airflow rate from the given information if you
also know the moisture content of the air leaving the dryer.
(a)Propose a method to estimate the moisture content of the exit air.

extraction  unit,  which  contains  0.78 kg  liquid  hexane/kg  dry  solids,  is  contacted  in  a  dryer  with
nitrogen that enters at 85°C. The solids leave the dryer containing 0.05 kg liquid hexane/kg dry solids,
and the gas leaves the dryer at 80°C and 1.0 atm with a relative saturation of 70%. The gas is then fed to
a condenser in which it is compressed to 5.0 atm and cooled to 28°C, enabling some of the hexane to
be recovered as condensate.
(a)Calculate the fractional recovery of hexane (kg condensed/kg fed in wet solids).
(b)A proposal has been made to split the gas stream leaving the condenser, combining 90% of
it  with  fresh  makeup  nitrogen,  heating  the  combined  stream  to  85°C,  and  recycling  the
heated stream to the dryer inlet. What fractionof the fresh nitrogen required in the process
of Part (a) would be saved by introducing the recycle? What costs would be incurred by
introducing  the  recycle?

Ammonia vapor produced by vaporizing pure liquid ammonia at 820 kPa absolute is mixed with air,
and the combined stream enters the ammonia oxidation unit. Air at 30°C, 1 atm absolute, and 50% relative
humidity is compressed and fed to the process. A fraction of the air is sent to the cooling and hydration
units, while the remainder is passed through a heat exchanger and mixed with the ammonia. Thetotal
oxygen fed to the process is the amount stoichiometrically required to convert all of the ammonia to
HNO
3
, while the fraction sent to the ammonia oxidizer corresponds to the stoichiometric amount required
to convert ammonia to NO.
The ammonia reacts completely in the oxidizer, with 97% forming NO and the rest forming N

Only a negligible amount of NO

is formed in the oxidizer. However, the gas leaving the oxidizer is
subjected to a series of cooling and hydration steps in which the NO is completely oxidized to NO
2
,
which in turn combines with water (some of which is present in the gas from the oxidizer and the rest is
added) to form a 55 wt% aqueous solution of nitric acid. The product gas from the process may be taken

6.63.The  feed  to  a  distillation  column  (sketched  below)  is  a  45.0  mole%n-pentane–55.0  mole%
n-hexane liquid mixture. The vapor stream leaving the top of the column, which contains 98.0 mole%
pentane and the balance hexane, goes to a total condenser (which means all the vapor is condensed).
Half of the liquid condensate is returned to the top of the column asrefluxand the rest is withdrawn as
overhead product (distillate) at a rate of 85.0 kmol/h. The distillate contains 95.0% of the pentane fed

and some of the vapor fed to each stage condenses. A representation of a section of a distillation
column is shown below. (See Problem 4.42 for a more realistic representation.)
Consider a distillation column operating at 0.4 atm absolute in which benzene and styrene are
being separated. A vapor stream containing 65 mole% benzene and 35 mole% styrene enters stage 1 at
a rate of 200 mol/h, and liquid containing 55 mole% benzene and 45 mole% styrene leaves this stage at
a rate of 150 mol/h. You may assume (1) the stages are ideal, (2) Raoult’s law can be used to relate the
compositions of the streams leaving each stage, and (3) the total vapor and liquid molarflow rates do
not change by a significant amount from one stage to the next.

A gas feed stream containing 5.0 mole% hexane vapor and the balance nitrogen enters at the
bottom of an absorption column at a basis rate of 100 mol/s, and a nonvolatile oil enters the top of
the column in a ratio 2 mol oil fed/mol gas fed. The absorber consists of a series of ideal stages
(see Problem 6.66), arranged so that gasflows upward and liquidflows downward. The liquid
and gas streams leaving each stage arein equilibrium with each other (by the definition of an
ideal stage), with compositions related by Raoult’s law. The absorber operates at an approxi-
mately constant temperatureT°Cand 760 mm Hg. Of the hexane entering the column, 99.5% is
absorbed and leaves in the liquid column effluent. At the given conditions it may be assumed that

strategy beginning at the bottom of the column and repeatedly applying Equations (1) and (2) until
the mole fraction of hexane in the vapor leaving the column is less than or equal to that calculated

6.74.A mixture of benzene and toluene is in a tank whose pressure is maintained at 2.0 atm. Observation

added until afinal solution volume of 500 mL is obtained. The solution is cooled slowly to 0°C while
being stirred and is maintained at this temperature long enough for crystallization to be complete. The
concentration of A in the supernatant liquid is then measured with the conductivity meter, yielding

6.87.Variousamino acidshave  utility  as  food  additives  and  in  medical  applications.  They  are  often
synthesized  by  fermentation  using  a  specific  microorganism  to  convert  a  substrate  (e.g.,  a  sugar)
into the desired product. Small quantities of other species also may be formed and must be removed to
meet product specifications. For example, isoleucine (Ile), which has a molecular weight of 131.2, is an
essential amino acid
16
produced by fermentation, and other amino acids such as leucine and valine also
are found in the fermentation broth. The broth is subjected to several processing steps to remove these
and other impurities, butfinal processing by crystallization is required to meet stringent specifications on
purity. The strategy is to crystallize the hydrated acid form of Ile (IleHClH
2
O), whose crystals exclude
other amino acids, and then to redissolve, neutralize, and crystallize thefinal Ile product.
In a batch process designed to manufacture 2500 kg of Ile per batch, an aqueous feed solution
containing 35 g Ile/dL and much lower concentrations of leucine and valine is fed to thefinal purification
stages. The pH of the solution is 1.1 and its specific gravity is 1.02. The solution is heated to 60°Cand
35-wt% HCl solution is added in a ratio of 0.4 kg per kg of feed. The addition of HCl causes the formation
of crystals of IleHClH
2
O, and the production of these crystals is further increased by slowly lowering
the temperature to 20°C. At thefinal crystallizer conditions the Ile solubility is 5 g Ile/100 g solution. The
resulting slurry is sent to a centrifuge where the crystals are separated from the liquid solution and the
crystal cake is washed with water. The solids leaving the centrifuge contain 12% free water (i.e., not part
of the crystal structure) and 88% pure crystals of IleHClH
2
O.
The washed crystals are redissolved in water to form a solution that is 4.0 g Ile/dL with a specific
gravity of 1.1. The solution is sent to an ion exchange unit where HCl is removed. Upon leaving the ion
exchange unit the solution has a pH of about 5.5. It is sent to a second crystallizer where the temperature
is gradually reduced to 10°C and the Ile solubility is 3.4 g Ile/100 g H
2
O. The crystals are separated from
the slurry by centrifugation, washed with pure water, and sent to a dryer forfinal processing.
(a)Construct a labeledflowchart for the process.
(b)Choosing a basis of 1 kg of feed solution, estimate (i) the mass of HCl solution added to the
system, (ii) the water added to redissolve the IleHClH

in the ion exchange unit, and (iv) the mass offinal Ile product.
(c)Scale the quantities calculated in Part (b) to the production rate of 2500 kg Ile/batch.
(d)Estimate the active volume (in liters) of each of the crystallizers.

(e)Amino acids are amphoteric, which means they can either donate or accept a proton (H
+
). At low
pH they tend to accept a proton and become acidic while at high pH they tend to donate a proton
and become basic. They also are known aszwitterionsbecause their ends are oppositely charged,
even though the overall molecule is neutral. Isoleucine is reported to have an isoelectric point (pI)
of 6.02 and pK
a
values of 2.36 and 9.60. Look up the meaning of these terms and prepare a plot
showing how these values are used in plotting the distribution of Ile between acid, zwitterionic
(neutral), and basic forms as a function of pH. Explain why such a distribution is important in
carrying out the separations described in the process.
6.88.Serine (Ser, molecular weight=105.1 g/mol) is a nonessential amino acid (see Footnote 16) produced by
fermentation. As with many other fermentation products, substantial downstream processing is required
to meet specifications on product purity. Crystallization from an aqueous solution is useful in meeting
those specifications. The following table shows how serine solubility in water varies with temperature:

6.91.An aqueous waste stream leaving a process contains 10.0 wt% sulfuric acid and 1 kg nitric acid per kg
sulfuric acid. Theflow rate of sulfuric acid in the waste stream is 1000 kg/h. The acids are neutralized

slurry of solid calcium carbonate that contains 2 kg of recycled liquid per kg solid calcium carbonate.

6.96.The separation of aromatic compounds from paraffins is essential in producing many polyesters that
are used in a variety of products. When aromatics and paraffins have the same number of carbon
atoms, they often have similar vapor pressures, which makes them difficult to separate by distillation.
Extraction is a viable alternative, as illustrated by the following simple system.
Sulfolane (an industrial solvent) and octane may be considered completely immiscible. At 25°C, the
ratio of the mass fraction of xylene in the octane-rich phase to the mass fraction of xylene in the sulfolane-
rich phase is 0.25. One hundred kg of pure sulfolane are added to 100 kg of a mixture containing 75 wt%
octane and 25% xylene, and the resulting system is allowed to equilibrate. How much xylene transfers to the
sulfolane phase?
6.97.A stream of 5.00 wt% oleic acid in cottonseed oil enters an extraction unit at a rate of 100.0 kg/h. The
unit operates as a single equilibrium stage (the streams leaving the unit are in equilibrium) at 85°C. At
this temperature, propane and cottonseed oil are essentially immiscible, the vapor pressure of propane
is 34 atm, and the distribution coefficient (oleic acid mass fraction in propane/oleic acid mass fraction
in cottonseed oil) is 0.15.

Demonstrate the logic of your decision by comparing the quantities of the two solvents required to
reduce the acetic acid content in 100 kg of an aqueous solution from 30 wt% to 10 wt%.
(b)What other factors may be important in choosing between benzene and cyclohexane?
6.99.Acetone is to be extracted withn-hexane from a 40.0 wt% acetone–60.0 wt% water mixture at 25°C. The
acetone distribution coefficient (mass fraction acetone in the hexane-rich phase/mass fraction acetone in
the water-rich  phase)  is  0.34.

Water  and  hexane  may  be  considered  immiscible.  Three  different
processing alternatives are to be considered: a two-stage process and two single-stage processes.
(a)In thefirst stage of the proposed two-stage process, equal masses of the feed mixture and pure
hexane are blended vigorously and then allowed to settle. The organic phase is withdrawn and the
aqueous phase is mixed with 75% of the amount of hexane added in thefirst stage. The mixture is
allowed to settle and the two phases are separated. What percentage of the acetone in the original
feed solution remains in the water at the end of the process?
(b)Suppose all of the hexane added in the two-stage process of Part (a) is instead added to the feed
mixture  and  the  process  is  carried  out  in  a  single  equilibrium  stage.  What  percentage  of  the
acetone in the feed solution remains in the water at the end of the process?
(c)Finally, suppose a single-stage process is used but it is desired to reduce the acetone content of the
water to thefinal value of Part (a). How much hexane must be added to the feed solution?
(d)Under what circumstances would each of the three processes be the most cost-effective? What
additional information would you need to make the choice?
6.100.Penicillin is produced by fermentation and recovered from the resulting aqueous broth by extraction
with butyl acetate. The penicillin distribution coefficientK(mass fraction of penicillin in the butyl
acetate phase/mass fraction of penicillin in the water phase) depends strongly on the pH in the aqueous

This dependence provides the basis for the process to be described. Water and butyl acetate may be

contacted with liquid butyl acetate in an extraction unit consisting of a mixer, in whichthe aqueous
and organic phases are brought into intimate contact with each other, followed by a settling tank, in
which the two phases separate under the influence of gravity. The pH of the aqueous phase in the
extraction unit equals 2.1. In the mixer 90% of the penicillin in the feed broth transfers from the
aqueous phase to the organic phase.
The two streams leaving the settler are in equilibrium with each other—that is, the ratio of the
penicillin mass fractions in the two phases equals the value ofKcorresponding to the pH of the
aqueous phase (2:1 in Unit 1). The impurities in the feed broth remain in the aqueous phase. The
raffinate(by definition, the product stream containing the feed-solution solvent) leaving Extraction
Unit  1  is  sent  elsewhere  for  further  processing,  and  the  organicextract(the  product  stream
containing the extracting solvent) is sent to a second mixer–settler unit.
In  the  second  unit,  the  organic  solution  fed  to  the  mixing  stage  is  contacted  with  an  alkaline
aqueous solution that adjusts the pH of the aqueous phase in the unit to 5.8. In the mixer, 90% of the
penicillin entering in the organic feed solution transfers to the aqueous phase. Once again, the two
streams emerging from the settler are in equilibrium. The aqueous extract is the process product.
(a)Taking a basis of 100 kg of acidified broth fed to thefirst extraction unit, draw and completely
label aflowchart of this process and carry out the degree-of-freedom analysis to show that all
labeled  variables  can  be  determined.  (Suggestion:Consider  the  combination  of  water,
impurities, and acid as a single species and the alkaline solution as a second single species,
since the components of these“pseudospecies”always stay together in the process.)
(b)Calculate the ratios (kg butyl acetate required/kg acidified broth) and (kg alkaline solution
required/kg acidified broth) and the mass fraction of penicillin in the product solution.
(c)Briefly explain the following:
(i)What is the likely reason for transferring most of the penicillin from an aqueous phase to
an organic phase and then transferring most of it back to an aqueous phase, when each
transfer leads to a loss of some of the drug?
(ii)What is the purpose of acidifying the broth prior to thefirst extraction stage, and why is
the extracting solution added to the second unit a base?
(iii)Why are the two“raffinates”in the process the aqueous phase leaving thefirst unit and
the organic phase leaving the second unit, and vice versa for the“extracts”? (Look again
at the definitions of these terms.)
(d)An alternative process for recovering the penicillin from the fermentation broth might involve
evaporation to dryness. In that case, all the water simply is evaporated. Give two possible
reasons for rejection of this alternative.

PART 3
Energy Balances



CHAPTER
7
Energy and Energy
Balances
Energy is expensive. We have not yet learned how to use efficiently the seemingly endless supply of
“free”energy provided by the sun, winds, and tides. Nuclear power generation is feasible, but the
need for safe disposal of radioactive wastes from nuclear reactors is a serious unresolved problem,
and there are not nearly enough waterfalls and dams to provide sufficient hydroelectric power to meet
the world’s energy needs. This leaves us with fuel combustion—burning a combustible gas, oil, or
solid fuel, and using the energy released as a source of thermal or (indirectly) electrical energy.
Process industries have always recognized that wasting energy leads to reduced profits, but
throughout much of the last century the cost of energy was often an insignificant part of the overall
process cost, and gross operational inefficiencies were tolerated. Beginning in the 1970s, a series
of sharp increases in the price of natural gas and petroleum raised the cost of energy severalfold
and intensified the need to eliminate unnecessary energy consumption. If a plant uses more energy
than its competitors, its product could be priced out of the marketplace.
As  an engineer designing  or operating  a process, one of your principal jobs  would be to
account carefully for the energy thatflows into and out of each process unit and to determine the
overall energy requirement for the process. You would do this by writingenergy balanceson the
process, in much the same way that you write material balances to account for the massflows to
and from the process and its units. Typical problems that may be solved using energy balances
include the following:
1.How much power (energy/time) is required to pump 1250 m
3
/h of water from a storage vessel
to a process unit? (The answer determines the size of the required pump motor.)
2.How much energy is required to convert 2000 kg of water at 30°C to steam at 180°C?
3.A hydrocarbon mixture is distilled, producing a liquid and a vapor stream, each with a known or
calculableflow rate and composition. The energy input to the distillation column is provided by
condensing saturated steam at a pressure of 15 bar. At what rate must steam be supplied to
process 2000 mol/h of the feed mixture?
4.A highly exothermic chemical reaction A!B takes place in a continuous reactor. If a 75%
conversion of A is to be achieved, at what rate must energy be transferred from the reactor to
keep the contents below a specified temperature?
5.How much coal must be burned each day to produce enough energy to generate the steam to run
the turbines to produce enough electricity to meet the daily power requirements of a city of
500,000 people?
6.A  chemical  process  consists  of  four  reactors,  25  pumps,  and  a  number  of  compressors,
distillation columns, mixing tanks, evaporators,filter presses, and other materials handling and
separation units. Each individual unit either requires or releases energy.
(a)How can the process operation be designed to minimize the total energy requirement? (For
example, can the energy released by an energy-emitting process unit be transferred to an
energy-absorbing process unit?)
(b)What is the total energy requirement for thefinal process design, and how much will it cost
to  provide  this  energy?  (The  answer  could  determine  whether  or  not  the  process  is

In this chapter we show how energy balances are formulated and applied. Section 7.1 defines
the types of energy a process system can possess and the ways in which energy can be transferred
to and from a system. Section 7.2 reviews the procedure for calculating the kinetic energy and
gravitational potential energy of a process stream. Sections 7.3 and 7.4 derive the general energy
balance for closed (batch) systems and open (semibatch and continuous) systems, and various
applications of these equations are illustrated in Sections 7.5 through 7.7.
7.0LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
List and define in your own words the three components of the total energy of a process system
and  the  two  forms  of  energy  transfer  between  a  system  and  its  surroundings.  State  the
conditions under which heat and work are positive. Convert a quantity of energy or power
(energy/time) expressed in any unit (e.g., J, dynecm, Btu, ftlb
f
/h, kW, hp) to its equivalent in
any other dimensionally consistent units.
Calculate the kinetic energy of a body of massmmoving with velocityuor the rate of transport
of kinetic energy by a stream moving with massflow rate

mand velocityu. Calculate the
gravitational potential energy of a body of massmat elevationzor the rate of transport of
gravitational potential energy by a stream moving with massflow rate
_
mat elevationz, wherez
is height above a reference plane at which potential energy is defined to equal zero.
Define  the  termsclosed process system, open process system, isothermal process,  and
adiabatic process. Write thefirst law of thermodynamics (the energy balance) for a closed
process system and state the conditions under which each of thefive terms in the balance can be
neglected. Given a description of a closed process system, simplify the energy balance and
solve it for whichever term is not specified in the process description.
Define  the  termsflow work, shaft work, specific internal energy, specific volume,  and
specific enthalpy. Write the energy balance for an open process system in terms of enthalpy
and shaft work and state the conditions under which each of thefive terms can be neglected.
Given a description of an open process system, simplify the energy balance and solve it for
whichever term is not specified in the process description.
State why the actual values of
^
Uand
^
Hcan never be known for a given species in a specified
state(temperature, pressure, and phase) and define the concept of areference state. Explain
in your own terms the statement,“The specific enthalpy of CO(g) at 100°C and 0.5 atm relative
to CO(g) at 500°C and 1 atm is12;141 J/mol.”(Your explanation should involve a process in
whi
ch carbon monox
ide gas goes from one state to another.)
Explain  why  the  reference  state  used  to  generate  a  table  of  specific  internal  energies  or
enthalpies is irrelevant if one is only interested in calculatingΔUorΔHfor a process. (The
term“state property”should appear in your explanation.)
Given a process in which a specified massmof a species goes from one state to another and
tabulated values of
^
Uor
^
Hfor the species at the initial andfinal states are available, calculate
ΔUorΔH. Given values of

vice versa. Carry out the corresponding calculations to determineΔ

Use  the  saturated  and  superheated  steam  tables  (Tables  B.5,  B.6,  and  B.7)  to  determine
(a)  whether  water  at  a  specified  temperature  and  pressure  is  liquid,  saturated  vapor,  or
superheated  vapor;  (b)  the  specific  volume,  specific  internal  energy,  and  specific  enthalpy
of liquid water or steam at a specified temperature and pressure; (c) the vapor pressure of water
356CHAPTER 7Energy and Energy Balances

at a specified temperature; (d) the boiling point of water at a specified pressure; and (e) the dew
point of superheated steam at a specified pressure.
Explain the significance of the specific internal energies and enthalpies tabulated in the
steam tables (B.5, B.6, and B.7), remembering that we can never know the true values of
either variable in a given state. Given any process in which a specified mass (or massflow
rate) of water changes from one state to another, use the steam tables to calculateΔU(or
Δ
_
U)and/orΔH(orΔ
_
H).
Given a description of any nonreactive process for which tabulated specific internal energies or
specific enthalpies are available at all input and output states for all process species, (a) draw
and completely label aflowchart, includingQandW(or
_

for an open system) if their
values are either specified or called for in a problem statement; (b) perform a degree-of-freedom
analysis; and (c) write the necessary equations (including the appropriately simplified energy
balance) to determine all requested variables.
Starting with the open system balance equation, derive the steady-state mechanical energy
balance equation (Equation 7.7-2) for an incompressiblefluid and simplify the equation
further to derive the Bernoulli equation. Listall the assumptions made in the derivation of
the latter equation.
Givenfluid conditions (pressure,flow rate, velocity, elevation) at the inlet and outlet of an open
system and values of friction loss and shaft work within the system, substitute known quantities
into the mechanical energy balance (or the Bernoulli equation if friction loss and shaft work can
be neglected) and solve the equation for whichever variable is unknown.
7.1FORMS OF ENERGY: THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
The total energy of a system has three components:
1. Kinetic energy:Energy due to the translational motion of the system as a whole relative to
some frame of reference (usually the earth’s surface) or to rotation of the system about some
axis. In this text, we will deal only with translational kinetic energy.
2. Potential energy:Energy due to the position of the system in a potentialfield (such as a
gravitational  or  electromagneticfield).  In  this  text,  we  will  deal  only  with  gravitational
potential energy.
3. Internal energy:All energy possessed by a system other than kinetic and potential energy,
such as energy due to the motion of molecules relative to the center of mass of the system, to the
rotational and vibrational motion and the electromagnetic interactions of the molecules, and to
the motion and interactions of the atomic and subatomic constituents of the molecules.
Suppose a process system isclosed, meaning that no mass is transferred across its boundaries
while  the  process  is  taking  place.  Energy  may  be  transferred  between  such  a  system  and  its
surroundings in two ways:
1.Asheat, or energy thatflows as a result of temperature difference between a system and its
surroundings. The direction offlow is always from a higher temperature to a lower one.Heat is
defined as positive when it is transferred to the system from the surroundings.
2.Aswork,  or  energy  thatflows  in  response  to  any  driving  force  other  than  a  temperature
difference, such as a force, a torque, or a voltage. For example, if a gas in a cylinder expands
and moves a piston against a restraining force,  the gas does work on the piston (energy is
transferred as work from the gas to its surroundings, which include the piston).In this text,
work—like heat—is defined as positive if it is transferred to the system from the surroundings.
7.1  Forms of Energy: The First Law of Thermodynamics357

(Note:The opposite sign convention is sometimes used. The choice is arbitrary, as long as it is
used consistently; however, to avoid confusion when reading thermodynamics references, you
should be sure which convention has been adopted.)
The terms“work”and“heat”refer only to energy that is being transferred: you can speak of
the heat or work added to a system or given off by a system, but it is meaningless to speak of the
heat or work possessed by or contained within a system.
Energy,  like  work,  has  units  of  force  times  distance:  for  example,  joulesNm,ergs
(dynecm), and ftlb
f
.Itisalsocommontouseenergyunitsdefinedintermsoftheamountof
heat that must be transferred to a specified mass of water to raise the temperature of the water
by a specified temperature interval at a constant pressure of 1 atm. The most common of these
units are tabulated here.

Conversion between these and other energy units may be performed using the conversion factors
in the table on the inside front cover.
The principle that underlies all energy balances is the law of conservation of energy, which
states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. This law is also called thefirst law of
thermodynamics.  In  its  most  general  form,  thefirst  law  states  that  the  rate  at  which  energy
kineticpotentialinternalis carried into a system by the input streams, plus the rates at which
it enters as heat and work, minus the rate at which it is transported out of the system by the output
streams,  equals  the  rate  of  accumulation  of  energy  in  the  system.  (That  is,  accumulation
inputoutput, as would be expected.)
Instead of presenting the equation in its most general form at this point, we will build up to it
in stages. The next section reviews how to evaluate the kinetic and potential energies of an object
and shows how the calculation can readily be extended to determine the rates at which kinetic and
potential energies are transported by aflowing stream. Section 7.3 presents an integrated form of
the transient balance equation that describes the behavior of a system between an initial state and a
final state. This form of the equation is particularly useful for analyzing batch process systems. In
Section 7.4 thefirst law is developed for a continuous steady-state process.
Most process systems are conveniently analyzed using one of the two forms of the energy
balance equation presented in Sections 7.3 and 7.4. To perform energy balance calculations on
other  types  of  processes,  such  as  semibatch  processes  or  continuous  processes  that  are  being
started up or shut down, the full transient energy balance equation is required. This equation is
discussed in an introductory fashion in Chapter 10. A more thorough treatment of the full equation
is deferred to thermodynamics courses and texts.

A gasflows through a long pipe of constant diameter. The outlet of the pipe is higher than the inlet,
and the pressure of the gas at the outlet is less than the inlet pressure. The gas temperature is
constant throughout the pipe and the system is at steady state.
1.How  do  the  massflow  rates  at  the  inlet  and  outlet  compare?  The  densities?  The
volumetricflow rates? (Assume ideal-gas behavior.)
2.Is the change in potential energy of the gas from inlet to outlet positive, negative, or

7.3ENERGY BALANCES ON CLOSED SYSTEMS
A system is termedopenorclosedaccording to whether or not mass crosses the system boundary
during the period of time covered by the energy balance. A batch process system is, by definition,
closed, and semibatch and continuous systems are open.
An integral energy balance may be derived for a closed system between two instants of time.
Since energy can neither be created nor destroyed, the generation and consumption terms of the
general balance (4.2-1) drop out, leaving
accumulationinputoutput(7.3-1)
In deriving the integral mass balance for a closed system in Section 4.2c we eliminated the
input and output terms, since by definition no mass crosses the boundaries of a closed system. It is
possible, however, for energy to be transferred across the boundaries as heat or work, so that the
right  side  of  Equation  7.3-1  may  not  be  eliminated  automatically.  As  with  mass  balances,
however, the accumulation term equals thefinal value of the balanced quantity (in this case, the
system energy) minus the initial value of this quantity. Equation 7.3-1 may therefore be written

Equation 7.3-4 is the basic form of thefirst law of thermodynamics for a closed system. When
applying this equation to a given process, you should be aware of the following points:
1.The internal energy of a system depends almost entirely on the chemical composition, state of
aggregation (solid, liquid, or gas), and temperature of the system materials. It is independent of
pressure  for  ideal  gases  and  nearly  independent  of  pressure  for  liquids  and  solids.If no
temperature changes, phase changes, or chemical reactions occur in a closed system and if
pressure changes are less than a few atmospheres, thenΔU0.

3.If a system and its surroundings are at the same temperature or the system is perfectly
insulated, then Q0. The process is then termedadiabatic.
4.Work done on or by a closed system is accomplished by movement of the system boundary
against a resisting force or the passage of an electrical current or radiation across the system
boundary. Examples of thefirst type of work are motion of a piston or rotation of a shaft that
projects through the system boundary.If there are no moving parts or electrical currents or
radiation at the system boundary, then W0.

Example 7.3-1Energy Balance on a Closed System
A gas is contained in a cylinderfitted with a movable piston.
Clamp
The initial gas temperature is 25°C.
The cylinder is placed in boiling water with the piston held in afixed position. Heat in the amount of
2.00 kcal is transferred to the gas, which equilibrates at 100°C (and a higher pressure). The piston is then
released, and the gas does 100 J of work in moving the piston to its new equilibrium position. Thefinal gas
temperature is 100°C.
Write the energy balance equation for each of the two stages of this process, and in each case solve for
the unknown energy term in the equation. In solving this problem, consider the gas in the cylinder to be the
system, neglect the change in potential energy of the gas as the piston moves vertically, and assume the gas
behaves ideally. Express all energies in joules.

7.4ENERGY BALANCES ON OPEN SYSTEMS AT STEADY STATE
An open process system by definition has mass crossing its boundaries as the process occurs.
Work must be done on such a system to push mass in, and work is done on the surroundings by
mass that emerges. Both work terms must be included in the energy balance.
In  Section 7.4a  we  outline  the  calculation  of the  work  (or  more  precisely,  the  rate  of
energy transferred as work) required to movefluid through a continuous process system, and
in Section 7.4b we review the concepts of intensive and extensive variables introduced in
Chapter 6 and introduce the concept of specific properties of a substance. Section 7.4c uses
the results of the two preceding sections to derive the energy balance for an open system at
steady state.

7.4b  Specific Properties and Enthalpy
As we observed in Section 6.2, the properties of a process material are either extensive (proportional
to the quantity of the material) or intensive (independent of the quantity). Mass, number of moles, and
volume (or massflow rate, molarflow rate, and volumetricflow rate for a continuous stream), and
kinetic energy, potential energy, and internal energy (or the rates of transport of these quantities by a
continuous stream) are extensive properties, while temperature, pressure, and density are intensive.
Aspecific propertyis an intensive quantity obtained by dividing an extensive property (or its
flow rate) by the total amount (orflow rate) of the process material. Thus, if the volume of afluid is
200 cm
3
and the mass of thefluid is 200 g, thespecific volumeof thefluid is 1 cm
3
/g. Similarly, if
the massflow rate of a stream is 100 kg/min and the volumetricflow rate is 150 L/min, the specific
volume of the stream material is (150 L/min=100 kg/min)=1.5 L/kg; if the rate at which kinetic
energy is transported by this stream is 300 J/min, then thespecific kinetic energyof the stream
material  is  (300 J/min)=(100 kg/min)=3 J/kg.We will use the symbol^to denote a specific
property:

(Why  do  the  accumulation,  generation,  and  consumption  terms  of  the  general  balance

energy,  and  internal  energy  by  all  process  input  streams  plus  the  rate  at  which  energy  is

at a linear velocity of 60 m/s and leaves at a point 5 m below the turbine inlet at atmospheric pressure and a
velocity of 360 m/s. The turbine delivers shaft work at a rate of 70 kW, and the heat loss from the turbine is

Note that the value 2919 J/mol for

1 atm is 2919 J/mol.
Some enthalpy tables give the reference states on which the listed values of

others do not;  however,  you do not  have to know the  reference state  to calculateΔ

Hfor  the
transition from one tabulated state to another. If

, regardless of the
reference state on which

and

are based. (Caution:If two different tables are used, be sure
^
H
1
and
^
H

are based on the same reference state.) For example,Δ
^
Hfor CO going from 100 to
500°C at 1 atm is15;0602919J/mol12;141 J/mol. If another reference state had been used
to generate the specific enthalpies of CO at 100°C and 500°C,

2
would have different
values but

H

H

would still be 12,141 J/mol. (See diagram below.)
This convenient result is a consequence of the fact that

Recall the phase diagram for water (Figure 6.1-1a), which has the following appearance:
P
T
Saturated liqui
d
Saturated steam
Superheated
steam
Subcooled
liquid
Solid
Pure water may coexist as liquid and vapor only at temperature–pressure pairs that fall on the
vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) curve. At points above the VLE curve (but to the right of the
solid–liquid equilibrium curve), water is asubcooled liquid. At points on the VLE curve, water
may besaturated liquidorsaturated steam(vapor) or a mixture of both. At points below the
VLE curve, water issuperheated steam.
For many years, compilations of physical properties of liquid water, saturated steam, and
superheated  steam  issued  insteam tableshave  been  standard  references  for  mechanical  and
chemical engineers involved with steam cycles for electrical power generation. Steam tables are
contained in Tables B.5–B.7 of this text. We recommend that you examine these tables as we
describe what you canfind in them.
Table B.5 lists properties of saturated liquid water and saturated steam at temperatures from
0.01°C (the triple-point temperature) to 102°C. The following properties can be determined for
each tabulated temperature (and for intermediate temperatures by interpolation):
Column 2.The pressure,P(bar), corresponding to the given temperature on the VLE curve—
by definition, the vapor pressure of water at the given temperature. Instead of looking up a
given temperature andfinding the pressure, you could look up a given pressure in the second
column andfind the corresponding boiling point temperature in thefirst column.
Columns 3 and 4.The specificvolumes,
^
Vm
3
/kg, of liquid water and saturated steam at the given
temperature. The inverses of thesequantities are the densities (kg/m
3
) of liquid water and steam.
Columns 5 and 6.The  specific  internal  energies,
^
UkJ/kg,  of  saturated  liquid  water  and
saturated steam at the given temperaturerelative to a reference state of liquid water at the triple
point. (Remember, we can never know the absolute value of internal energy or enthalpy, but
only how these quantities change when the substance goes from one state to another—in this
case, from the reference state to the states listed in the table.)
Columns 7–9.The specific enthalpies,
^
HkJ/kg, of saturated liquid water (Column 7) and
saturated steam (Column 9), and the difference between these quantities, known as theheat of
vaporization(Column 8). The reference point for the tabulated values of
^
His again liquid water
at the triple point.
Table B.6  lists  the  same  properties  as  Table  B.5,  except  that  pressure  is thefirst  column and
temperature the second, and the table covers a much broader range of temperatures and pressures.
Tables B.5 and B.6 are commonly referred to as thesaturated steam tables.
Table B.7—which is referred to as thesuperheated steam table—lists
^
V,
^
U,and
^
Hof water (the
latter two properties relative to liquid water at the triple point) atanytemperature and pressure, not just
at points on the VLE curve. If you are given a temperature and a pressure, you can locate the properties
of water  at the intersection of the  column corresponding to the  given  temperature  and the row
corresponding to the given pressure. If the intersection falls within the closed region on the table
bounded by the vertical line to the left of the 50°C column, the horizontal line below the 221.2 bar
row, and the stair-step border, the water is a liquid; outside this region, it is a superheated vapor.
370CHAPTER 7Energy and Energy Balances

When you look up a pressure in thefirst column of Table B.7, you willfind just below it in
parentheses  the  boiling-point  temperature and in Columns  2 and  3 the  properties  of saturated
liquid water and saturated steam at that pressure. If you are at a point in the superheated steam
region, you can move all the way to the left to determine the saturation temperature at the same
pressure, also known as thedew pointof the superheated steam.
The next example illustrates the use of these tables to obtain physical property data for water.
Example 7.5-2The Steam Tables
1.Determine  the  vapor  pressure,  specific  internal  energy,  and  specific  enthalpy  of  saturated  steam  at
133.5°C.
2.Show that water at 400°C and 10 bar is superheated steam and determine its specific volume, specific
internal energy, and specific enthalpy relative to liquid water at the triple point, and its dew point.
3.Show that
^
Uand
^
Hfor superheated steam depend strongly on temperature and relatively slightly on
pressure.
SolutionVerify the results to be given.

3.Look at the properties of water at 400°C and 450°C, both at a pressure of 10 bar. You will see that
both

^
Hchange by about 3% when water goes from thefirst temperature to the second one
(3264 kJ/kg→3371 kJ/kg for
^
H, 2958 kJ/kg→3041 kJ/kg for
^
U).
Now consider the properties at 10 bar and 20 bar, both at a temperature of 400°C. Even though
the pressure has doubled, the values of
^
Uand
^
Hchange by much less than 1%. Similar results would
be obtained for liquid water. The conclusion is that when you need a value of
^
Uor
^
Hfor water (or for

necessary—but you don’t have tofind it at the exact pressure.
The next example illustrates the use of the steam tables to solve energy balance problems.

Steam at 10 bar absolute with 190°C of superheat is fed to a turbine at a rate
_
m2000 kg/h. The turbine
operation is adiabatic, and the effluent is saturated steam at 1 bar. Calculate the work output of the turbine in
kilowatts, neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy.

7.6ENERGY BALANCE PROCEDURES
A properly drawn and labeledflowchart is essential for the efficient solution of energy balance
problems. When labeling theflowchart, be sure to include all of the information you will need to
determine the specific enthalpy of each stream component, including known temperatures and
pressures. In addition, show states (phases) of process materials when they are not obvious: do not
simply write H
2
O, for example, but rather H
2
O(s), H
2
O(l), or H
2
O(v), according to whether water
is present as a solid, a liquid, or a vapor.
In the rest of this chapter, we will consider only species (such as water) for which tabulated
internal energies or enthalpies are available. In Chapters 8 and 9 we will show how to choose
reference states and calculate the required values of
^
Uand
^
Hwhen tabulated values cannot be
found.
Example 7.6-1Energy Balance on a One-Component Process
Two streams of water are mixed to form the feed to a boiler. Process data are as follows:
Feed stream 1120 kg/min @ 30°C
Feed stream 2175 kg/min @ 65°C
Boiler pressure17 bar (absolute)
Steam emerges from the boiler through a 6-cm ID pipe. Calculate the required heat input to the boiler in
kilojoules per minute if the emerging steam is saturated at the boiler pressure. Neglect the kinetic energies of
the liquid inlet streams.

1.Afirst step in solving problems of this sort is to determine(if possible)theflow rates of all stream
components using material balances.In this case, it is a trivial matter to write and solve a mass balance on
water to determine that theflow rate of the emerging steam is 295 kg/min.

2.Next, determine the specific enthalpies of each stream component.Tables B.5 and B.6 were used to
determine
^
Hfor liquid water at 30°C and 65°C and for saturated steam at 17 bar. The latter entry in the
table also furnished the temperature of the saturated steam corresponding to this pressure (204°C). Note
that the entries for liquid water correspond to pressures that may or may not equal the actual pressures of
the inlet  streams  (which  we do not know);  we assume,  however, that  the  enthalpy of liquid  water  is
approximately independent of pressure and use the tabulated values.
3.Thefinal step is to write the appropriate form of the energy balance and solve it for the desired quantity.

Observe that the kinetic energy change is only a small fraction—roughly 0.8%—of the total energy
requirement for the process. This is a typical result, and it is common to neglect kinetic and potential energy
changes  (at  least  as  afirst  approximation)  relative  to  enthalpy  changes  for  processes  that  involve  phase
changes, chemical reactions, or large temperature changes.
7.6  Energy Balance Procedures373

When  process  streams  contain  several  components,  the  specific  enthalpies  of  each
component  must  be  determined  separately  and  substituted  in  the  energy  balance  equation

His evaluated.For mixtures of near-ideal gases or of liquids with similar molecular
structures(e.g., mixtures of paraffins),you may assume that
^
H for a mixture component is the
same as
^
H for the pure substance at the same temperature and pressure. Procedures to follow
for solutions of gases or solids in liquids and formixtures of dissimilarliquids are outlined in
Chapter 8.
Example 7.6-2Energy Balance on a Two-Component Process
A liquid stream containing 60.0 mole% ethane and 40.0%n-butane is to be heated from 150 K to 200 K at a
pressure of 1 MPa. Calculate the required heat input per kmol of the mixture, neglecting potential and kinetic

The enthalpies ofn-butane at 150 K and 1 MPa and at 200 K and 1 MPa are given on p. 2-232 ofPerry’s
Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see  Footnote  2),  and  those  of  ethane  at  the  same  conditions  can  be
obtained by interpolation of values on p. 2-263 of theHandbook. The enthalpy values are shown in the

In the two previous examples, it was possible to complete all material-balance calculations
before undertaking the energy balance. In another class of problems one more stream amount or
flow rate is unknown than can be determined by material balances alone. To solve problems of this
type, you must write and solve material and energy balances simultaneously.
374CHAPTER 7Energy and Energy Balances

Example 7.6-3Simultaneous Material and Energy Balances
Superheated steam at 300°C and 1 atm (absolute) is to be fed to a heat exchanger. It is produced by mixing
an available stream of saturated steam at 1 atm discharged from a turbine at a rate of 1150 kg/h with a
second  stream  of  superheated  steam  at  400°C  and  1 atm.  The  mixing  may  be  considered  adiabatic.
Calculate the amount of superheated steam at 300°C produced and the required volumetricflow rate of the
400°C steam.
SolutionSpecific enthalpies of the two feed streams and the product stream are obtained from the steam tables

and 1 bar.)

7.7MECHANICAL ENERGY BALANCES
In chemical process units such as reactors, distillation columns, evaporators, and heat exchang-
ers, shaft work and kinetic and potential energy changes tend to be negligible compared with heat
7.7  Mechanical Energy Balances375

flows and internal energy and enthalpy changes. Energy balances on such units therefore usually
omit the former terms and so take the simple formQΔU(closed system) or
_
QΔ
_
H(open
system).
Another important class of operations is one for which the opposite is true—heatflows and
internal energy changes are secondary in importance to kinetic and potential energy changes and
shaft  work.  Most  of  these  operations  involve  theflow  offluids  to,  from,  and  between  tanks,
reservoirs,  wells,  and  process  units.  Accounting  for  energyflows  in  such  processes  is  most
conveniently done withmechanical energy balances.
The general form of the mechanical energy balance can be derived starting with the open-
system  balance  and  a  second  equation  expressing  the  law  of  conservation  of  momentum,  a
derivation beyond the scope of this book. This section presents a simplified form for a single
incompressible liquidflowing into and out of a process system at steady state.
Consider such a system, letting
_
mbe the massflow rate and
^
Vthe specific volume of the
liquid. If
^
Vis replaced by 1=ρ, whereρis the liquid density, then the open-system energy balance
(Equation 7.4-12) may be written

In many cases only slight amounts of heat are transferred to or from the surroundings, there is
little change in temperature from inlet to outlet, and no phase changes or reactions occur. Even
under these circumstances, some kinetic or potential energy is always converted to thermal energy
as a result of friction due to the movement of thefluid through the system. In consequence, the
quantityΔ

Methods  of  estimating  friction  losses  forflow  through  straight  pipes,  orifices,  nozzles,
elbows,  and  so  on  are  given  in  Section  10  ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see
Footnote 2) and will not be discussed in this text. In the balance of this book we consider only
processes in which friction losses are either specified or neglected.

A common type of problem to which the mechanical energy balance is applicable is one that
involves drainage or siphoning of a liquid from a container. A suitable choice of the locations of
points
1
and
2
greatly simplifies such problems; it is convenient to choose as point
1
a location
on the liquid surface in the tank being drained and to take point
2
at the discharge stream outlet. If
7.7  Mechanical Energy Balances377

the container is being drained relatively slowly, the kinetic energy at point
1
may be neglected.
Example 7.7-2 illustrates the computational procedure for such problems.

The last illustration we will consider is onein which the potential energy lost by falling
water is converted to electrical energy by means of a turbine and generator. The work done by
the water in rotating the turbine must be included as shaft work in the energy balance.
Example 7.7-3Hydraulic Power Generation
Waterflows from an elevated reservoir through a conduit to a turbine at a lower level and out of the turbine
through a similar conduit. At a point 100 m above the turbine the pressure is 207 kPa, and at a point 3 m
below  the  turbine  the  pressure  is  124 kPa.  What  must  the  waterflow  rate  be  if  the  turbine  output  is

7.7  Mechanical Energy Balances379

7.8  SUMMARY
Considerable amounts of energy are required to run most chemical
processes.  Engineers  useenergy balancesto  account  for  the
energy thatflows into or out of each unit of a process, to determine
the net energy requirement for the process, and to design ways to
reduce   the   energy   requirement   so   as   to   improve   process
profitability.
The total energy of a process system has three components:
kinetic energy—energy due to motion of the system as a
whole;potential energy—energy due to the position of the
system in a potentialfield (such as the earth’s gravitational
field); andinternal energy—energy due to the translation,
rotation, vibration, and electromagnetic interactions of the
molecules,   atoms,   and   subatomic   particles   within   the
system.
In aclosed system(no mass is transferred across the system
boundaries while the process is taking place), energy may be
transferred  between  the  system  and  its  surroundings  in  two
ways: asheat—energy thatflows due to a temperature differ-
ence between the system and its surroundings, and aswork—
energy thatflows in response to any other stimulus such as an
applied force, a torque, or a voltage. Heat alwaysflows from a
higher  temperature  to  a  lower  temperature.  Heat  is  always
defined to be positive if itflows to a system from the surround-
ings, and in many engineering references (including this one)
work is also defined as positive if itflows to the system from the
surroundings.

power does it provide? Express the answer both in kW and horsepower.
(b)Suppose the fuel is changed to include 10% ethanol by volume. The heating value of ethanol is
approximately 2:3410
4
kJ/L and volumes of gasoline and ethanol may be assumed additive. At
what rate (L/h) does the fuel mixture have to be consumed to produce the same power as gasoline?
7.2.Consider an automobile with a mass of 5500 lb

braking to a stop from a speed of 55 miles/h.
(a)How much energy (Btu) is dissipated as heat by the friction of the braking process?
(b)Suppose that throughout the United States, 300,000,000 such braking processes occur in the course
of a given day. Calculate the average rate (megawatts) at which energy is being dissipated by the
resulting friction.
(c)Find a source of information on the average per-capita consumption of electricity (kW) in the
United States, France, and India. Roughly how many people in each country would have their
electricity needs met if the braking energy calculated in Part (b) could be recovered and used to
provide electricity? Show your calculations and identify your information source.

You woke up hungry this morning so you ate a breakfast of hotcakes, eggs, and a large biscuit. An
online application indicates that this meal contains 1090 calories (meaning food calories).

calories you consumed? Make a reasonable assumption about the height of aflight of stairs, and
state any other assumptions you make.
(b)The required height of the climb would almost certainly be different from the number calculated in
Part (a), even if your assumption about the height of aflight of stairs is correct. Explain why you

In the late 1970s, supermarkets began to replace paper sacks with polyethylene (plastic) sacks. In the
1980s, a movement to go back to paper arose, primarily inspired by environmental considerations. In
the 1990s, a countermovement arose, claiming that paper sacks have a greater negative environmental
impact than plastic ones.
Following are estimates of the atmospheric emissions and energy consumption associated with the
raw materials acquisition and processing (logging, pulping, and papermaking for paper, petroleum
production  and  refining  and  polymerization  for  polyethylene)  and  disposal  of  sacks,  and  for  the
manufacture and use of sacks.

Assume that atmospheric emissions and energy consumption do not depend on whether the new sacks
are made from fresh raw materials or recycled sacks, and that it takes roughly twice as many plastic

(a)Calculate the air emissionslb

2000 plastic sacks used, assuming that no sacks are recycled.
(b)Repeat the calculations of Part (a) assuming that 60% of the used sacks are recycled. By what
percentages are air emissions and energy consumption reduced for each sack material as a
consequence of recycling?
(c)Estimate the number of grocery sacks used in a day in the United Statespopulation320 million,
and  calculate  the  average  rate  of  energy  consumption  (megawatts,  MW)  associated  with  the
production, use, and disposal of these sacks, assuming that they are plastic and none are recycled.
How many MW would be saved by 60% recycling?
(d)You should have found that both atmospheric emissions and energy consumption are higher when
paper is used rather than plastic, although recycling reduces the differences. Nevertheless, deciding
to use plastic based entirely on this result could be a serious mistake. List several important factors
that were not taken into account in making the decision, including considerations of the potential

Energy may be produced from solid waste in two ways: (1) generate methane from anaerobic decomposition
of the waste and burn it (landfill-gas-to-energy, or LFGTE) or (2) burn the waste directly (waste-to-energy, or
WTE). The heat generated by either method can be used to produce steam, which impinges on a turbine rotor
connected to a generator to produce electricity. LFGTE produces about 215 kWh electricity/ton of waste,
and WTE produces roughly 600 kWh/ton of waste. The average output of a large power plant is 1 GW,
which is enough to supply the annual residential energy consumption of a city of roughly 800,000 people.

discharge.  Thefloat  then  drops  down  to  its  original  position  and  the  valve  closes,  preventing
uncondensed steam from escaping.
(a)Suppose saturated steam at 25 bar is used to heat 100 kg/min of an oil from 135°C to 185°C. Heat
must be transferred to the oil at a rate of 1:0010
4
kJ/min to accomplish this task. The steam
condenses on the exterior of a bundle of tubes through which the oil isflowing. Condensate collects
in the bottom of the exchanger and exits through a steam trap set to discharge when 1200 g of liquid
is collected. How often does the trap discharge?
(b)Especially when periodic maintenance checks are not performed, steam traps often fail to close
completely and so leak steam continuously. Suppose a process plant contains 1000 leaking traps
(not an unrealistic supposition for some plants) operating at the condition of Part (a), and that on the
average 10% additional steam must be fed to the condensers to compensate for the uncondensed
steam venting through the leaks. Further suppose that the cost of generating the additional steam is
$7.50 per million Btu, where the denominator refers to the enthalpy of the leaking steam relative to
liquid water at 20°C. Estimate the yearly cost of the leaks based on 24 h/day, 360 day/yr operation.
7.39.A turbine discharges 200 kg/h of saturated steam at 10.0 bar absolute. It is desired to generate steam at
250°C and 10.0 bar by mixing the turbine discharge with a second stream of superheated steam of
300°C and 10.0 bar.

(b)If instead the mixing is carried out adiabatically, at what rate is the product steam generated?

valve
2
, where itflashes to a low pressure, cooling to its boiling point at this pressure and partially
evaporating. The liquid–vapor mixture passes though anevaporator coil
3
. Air from the food storage
area circulates over the coil, and the heat absorbed by the evaporating refrigerant in the coil causes the
air to cool. The cold refrigerant vapor emerging from the coil passes to acompressor
4
, where it is
brought back to a high pressure and in the process is raised to a high temperature. The hot vapor then
passes through acondenser
5
, where it is cooled and condensed at constant pressure. The air that
absorbs  the  heat  given  up  by  the  condensingfluid  is  discharged  outside  the  refrigerator,  and  the
liquefied refrigerant returns to the liquid receiver.

Suppose  that  one  had  been installed  and that  it  was  designed  to open  when the  tank pressure

it to the atmosphere. At what temperature would the valve open? At what rate would the relief
valve need to release steam (kg/kJ of added heat) in order to keep the tank pressure from rising

7.52.Horatio  Meshuggeneh  has  his  own  ideas  of  how  to  do  things.  For  instance,  when  given  the  task  of
determining an oven temperature, most people woulduse a thermometer. Being allergic to doing anything
most people would do, however, Meshuggeneh instead performs the following experiment. He puts a copper
bar with a mass of 5.0 kg in the oven and puts an identicalbar in a well-insulated 20.0-liter vessel containing
5.00 L of liquid water and the remainder saturated steam at 760 mm Hg absolute. He waits long enough for
both bars to reach thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, then quickly takes thefi
rst bar out of the oven,
re
moves t
he second bar from the vessel, drops thefirst bar in its place, covers the vessel tightly, waits for the
contents to come to equilibrium, and notes the reading on a pressure gauge built into the vessel. The value he
reads is 50.1 mm Hg. He then uses the facts that copper has a specific gravity of 8.92 and a specific internal
energy given by the expression
^
UkJ/kg0:36T°Cto calculate the oven temperature.
(a)The Meshuggeneh assumption is that the bar can be transferred from the oven to the vessel without
any  heat  being  lost.  If  he  makes  this  assumption,  what  oven  temperature  does  Meshuggeneh
calculate? How many grams of water evaporate in the process? (Neglect the heat transferred to the
vessel wall—i.e., assume that the heat lost by the bar is transferred entirely to the water in the vessel.
Also, remember that you are dealing with a closed system once the hot bar goes into the vessel.)
(b)In fact, the bar lost 8.3 kJ of heat between the oven and the vessel. What is the true oven temperature?
(c)The experiment just described was actually Meshuggeneh’s second attempt. Thefirst time he tried
it, thefinal gauge pressure in the vessel was negative. What had he forgotten to do?

is done by the system when it moves the piston through a vertical displacement. The magnitude of
this work isWPΔV, wherePis the constant system pressure andΔVis the change in system

meter (Section 3.2b). It consists of a tapered constriction in a line, with pressure taps leading to a
differential manometer at points upstream of the constriction and at the point of maximum constriction
(thethroat). The manometer reading is directly related to theflow rate in the line.

Arsenic  contamination  of  aquifers  is  a  major  health  problem  in  much  of  the  world  and  is
particularly severe in Bangladesh. One method of removing the arsenic is to pump water from
an aquifer to the surface and through a bed packed with granular material containing iron oxide,
which binds the arsenic. The purified water is then either used or allowed to seep back through the
ground into the aquifer.
In  an  installation  of  the  type  just  described,  a  pump  draws  69.1  gallons  per  minute  of
contaminated  water  from  an  aquifer  through  a  3-inch  ID  pipe  and  then  discharges  the  water
through a 2-inch ID pipe to an open overhead tankfilled with granular material. The water leaves

8.1ELEMENTS OF ENERGY BALANCE CALCULATIONS

to  both  nonreactive  processes  (this  chapter)  and  reactive  processes  (Chapter  9).  Section  8.1a
reviews the concept of areference statefor specific internal energy and enthalpy calculations, and

heating  and  cooling,  compression  and  decompression,  phase  changes,  mixing  of  liquids,  and
dissolving of gases and solids in liquids.

^
U(kJ/mol) is the sum of the energies of motion of all 6:0210

molecules in one gram-mole of
the species plus the intramolecular kinetic and potential energies of all the atoms and subatomic
particles, which are quantities we cannot determine. Since

404CHAPTER 8Balances on Nonreactive Processes

8.1b Hypothetical Process Paths
In Chapter 7, we observed that
^
Uand
^
Harestate propertiesof a species: that is, their values
depend only on the state of the species—primarily on its temperature and state of aggregation
(solid, liquid, or gas) and, to a lesser extent, on its pressure (and for mixtures of some species, on
its mole fraction in the mixture). A state property does not depend on how the species reached its
state. Consequently,when a species passes from one state to another, bothΔ
^
UandΔ
^
H for the
process are independent of the path taken from thefirst state to the second one.
In most of this chapter and in Chapter 9, you will learn how to calculate internal energy and
enthalpy changes associated with certain processes: specifically,
1.Changes in P at constant T and state of aggregation(Section 8.2).
2.Changes in T at constant P and state of aggregation(Section 8.3).
3.Phase changes at constant T and P—melting, solidifying, vaporizing, condensing, sublimating
(Section 8.4).
4.MixingoftwoliquidsordissolvingofagasorasolidinaliquidatconstantTandP(Section 8.5).
5.Chemical reaction at constant T and P(Chapter 9).
For  example,  compressing  hydrogen  gas  from  1 atm  to  300 atm  at  25°C  is  a  Type  1  process;
melting ice at 0°C and then heating the liquid water to 30°C, all at 1 atm, is a Type 3 process
followed by a Type 2 process; mixing sulfuric acid and water at a constant temperature of 20°C
and a constant pressure of 1 atm is a Type 4 process.
Once  we  know  how  to  calculateΔ
^
UandΔ
^
Hfor  thesefive  types  of  processes,  we  can
calculate these quantities foranyprocess by taking advantage of the fact that
^
Uand
^
Hare state
properties. The procedure is to construct a hypotheticalprocess pathfrom the initial state to the
final state consisting of a series of steps of the givenfive types. Having done this, we calculateΔ
^
H
for each of the steps, and then add theΔ
^
H’s for the steps to calculateΔ
^
Hfor the total process.
Since
^
H is a state property,Δ
^
H
calculated for the
hypothetical process path—which we
constructed for convenience—is the same asΔ
^
H for the path actually followed by the process.
The same procedure can be followed to calculateΔ
^
Ufor any process.
Suppose, for example, that we wish to calculateΔ
^
Hfor a process in which solid phenol at
25°C and 1 atm is converted to phenol vapor at 300°C and 3 atm. If we had a table of enthalpies for
phenol, we could simply subtract
^
Hat the initial state from
^
Hat thefinal state, or
Δ
^
H
^
Hvapor;300°C;3 atm
^
Hsolid;25°C;1 atm
However, we do not have such a table. Our task is then to construct a hypothetical process path
from the solid at 25°C and 1 atm to the vapor at 300°C and 3 atm. To do so, we will look ahead a bit
and note that Table B.1 gives enthalpy changes for the melting of phenol at 1 atm and 42.5°C (the
normal melting point of phenol) and for the vaporization of phenol at 1 atm and 181.4°C (the
normal boiling point of phenol). We therefore choose the following hypothetical process path:

Notice that in this path, thefirst, third, andfifth steps are Type 2 (change inTat constantP), the
second and fourth steps are Type 3 (change in phase at constantTandP), and the sixth step is
Type 1 (change inPat constantT). Also notice that the phase changes were made to occur at the
conditions for which tabulated enthalpy changes are available.
The next step in the calculation would be to determine the values ofΔ

8.1c  Procedure for Energy Balance Calculations
Most of the problems at the end of this chapter and Chapter 9 look very much like the problems in
Chapters 4 to 6: given values of some process variables (feed and product stream temperatures,
pressures, phases, amounts orflow rates, and component mole fractions), calculate values of other
process variables. Starting in this chapter, you will also be asked to calculate the heat transferred to
or from the process system (one additional variable), which will require writing and solving an
energy balance (one additional equation).
Here is the procedure to follow for the energy balance calculation.
1.Perform all required material balance calculations.
2.Write the appropriate form of the energy balance(closed or open system)and delete any of the
terms that are either zero or negligible for the given process system.For a stationary closed
system, dropΔE
k
andΔE
p
, and neglectWif the system volume is constant, there are no moving
parts (such as a mixing impeller in a stirred tank), and no energy is transferred to or from the
system by electricity or radiation. For an open system at steady state, dropΔ
_
E
p
if there is no
appreciable vertical separation between the inlet and outlet ports, and drop
_
W
s
if there are no
moving parts (such as a pump or turbine impeller) and no energy is transferred by electricity or
radiation. In addition, if temperature changes of more than a few degrees, phase changes, or
chemical reactions occur in the process,Δ
_
E
k
usually is negligible compared toΔ
_
UandΔ
_
Hand so
may be deleted from the equation.

the process.If

3.Choose reference states for acetone and nitrogen.
The reference states may be chosen for computational convenience, since the choice has no
effect  on  the  calculated  value  ofΔ
_
H.  We  will  arbitrarily  choose  the  inlet  stream  condition  for
nitrogen  (65°C,  1 atm)  as  the  reference  state  for  this  species  and  one  of  the  two  outlet  stream
conditions for acetone (l, 20°C, 5 atm) as the reference state for acetone, which will enable us to set
the corresponding values for
^
Hin the enthalpy table equal to zero instead of having to calculate them.
4.Construct an inlet—outlet enthalpy table.
Wefirst write the chosen reference states, then construct the table shown below:

Note the following points about the table:
Nitrogen has only one inlet state (gas, 65°C, 1 atm) and one outlet state (gas, 20°C, 5 atm), so we
need only one row in the table for N
2
. Acetone has one inlet state (vapor, 65°C, 1 atm) but two
outlet states (vapor and liquid, each at 20°C and 5 atm), so we need two rows for this species.
We mark out (using dashes) the two cells corresponding to
_
n
in
and
^
H
in
for liquid acetone, since no
liquid acetone enters the system.
The
_
nvalues are obtained from theflowchart. Theflow rate of acetone vapor at the inlet, for
example, is determined as (100 mol/s)[0.669 mol Ac(v)/mol]=66.9 mol Ac(v)/s.
Since the nitrogen entering the system and the liquid acetone leaving the system area are at their
reference states, we set their specific enthalpies equal to zero.
Three unknown specific enthalpies have been labeled and must be determined in Step 5.
5.Calculate all unknown specific enthalpies.
To  calculate  the  three  unknown  specific  enthalpies  in  the  table,  we  construct  hypothetical
process paths from the reference states to the states of the species in the process and evaluateΔ
^
Hfor
each path. This is the part of the calculation you have not yet learned to do. We will show you the
calculation of

about the required procedures in Sections 8.2–8.5.

A time-saving alternative for evaluating the integral by hand is to use theAPEx function
Enthalpy(“species”,T1,T2,[temp. units],[state]), beginning the cell entry with an equal sign. The
function  integrates  the  heat  capacity  formula  in  Table  B.2  for  the  specified  species  from
temperatureT1to temperatureT2and returnsΔ
^
Hin kJ/mol. If a temperature unit is not specified
as“K,”“R,”or“F,”a unit of“C”is assumed. If the state of the species is not specified as“l,”“g,”
or“c”(for solid), thefirst entry in Table B.2 is assumed.
For example, the integrals of the heat capacity of acetone liquid and acetone vapor needed in
this example would be calculated using the following formulas:
Enthalpy“acetone”;20;56
Enthalpy“acetone”;56;65;;“g”
Notice that internal arguments that go to their default values, like the temperature unit in thefirst
formula, may be left blank but the commas around them must still be supplied. Default values of
arguments at the end, such as the temperature unit and state in the second formula, may be omitted.

CHAPTER 8Balances on Nonreactive Processes

It remains for us to outline methods for calculatingΔ

UandΔ
^
Hfor the different types of
processes we have discussed. The methods for thefirst four (change inPat constantT, change inT
at constantP, change in phase at constantTandP, and mixing or dissolving at constantTandP)
are outlined in Sections 8.2–8.5 of this chapter, and methods for chemical reactions at constant
TandPare given in Chapter 9.
8.2CHANGES IN PRESSURE AT CONSTANT TEMPERATURE
It has been observed experimentally that internal energy is nearly independent of pressure for solids
and liquids at afixed temperature, as is specific volume. Therefore,if the pressure of a solid or liquid
changes at constant temperature, you may writeΔ

The specific molar volume

conversions typically are needed to make the units of
^
VΔPconsistent with the more common
units of terms in energy balances (e.g., kJ/mol). The table for the gas constant on the inside back
cover of this text provides useful conversion factors. For example, if you know
^
Vin L/mol andΔP
in atm, and you want
^
VΔPin kJ/mol, look for two values of the gas constant with units of Latm
and kJ and use their ratio as a conversion factor. The calculation would look like this:

available for the gas, there is of course no need to make this assumption.] If gases are far from ideal
or if they undergo large pressure changes, you must either use tables of thermodynamic properties

determineΔ

8.3CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE
8.3a  Sensible Heat and Heat Capacities
The termsensible heatsignifies heat that must be transferred to raise or lower the temperature of a
substance or mixture of substances. The quantity of heat required to produce a temperature change
in a system can be determined from the appropriate form of thefirst law of thermodynamics:
QΔUclosed system(8.3-1)
_

Hopen system(8.3-2)
(We have neglected kinetic and potential energy changes and work.) To determine the sensible
heat requirement for a heating or cooling process, you must therefore be able to determineΔUor
Δ
_
Hfor the specified temperature change.
The  specific  internal  energy  of  a  substance  depends  strongly  on  temperature.  If  the
temperature is  raised  or  lowered  in such  a  way  that  the  system  volume remains  constant,  the
specific internal energy might vary as shown in the following plot:

CREATIVITY EXERCISE
Your task this time is to estimate the heat capacity of an unknown liquid. You have available a
laboratory  balance,  a  very  well-insulated  container,  a  sensitive  thermometer  that  can  measure
liquid temperatures, and a thermocouple that can measure temperatures of solids. The container is
a very poor conductor of heat, so that virtually all heat transferred to or from its contents goes
entirely into changing the temperature of those contents. If you need anything else (within reason),
you  can  get  it.  Devise  as  many  ways  as  you  can  to  estimateC
v

independent of temperature. [Example:Mix in the insulatedflask a known mass,m

They may be expressed in any units
of energy per unit species amount (mass or moles) per unit temperature interval—for example,
J/(molK), or Btu/(lb

various other substances are given on pp. 2-183 to 2-185.
When reading the coefficients of a heat capacity formula from Table B.2, do not mistake their

Example 8.3-2Cooling of an Ideal Gas
Assuming ideal-gas behavior, calculate the heat that must be transferred in each of the following cases.
1.A stream of nitrogenflowing at a rate of 100 mol/min is heated from 20°C to 100°C.
2.Nitrogen contained in a 5-literflask at an initial pressure of 3 bar is cooled from 90°Cto30°C.
SolutionNeglecting kinetic energy changes, the energy balance for the open system of Part 1 isQΔH, and that for
the closed system of Part 2 isQΔU. (Show it.) The problem is therefore to evaluateΔHandΔUfor the two
specified processes.

Reminder:The enthalpies listed in Tables B.8 and B.9 (and for that matter, the heat capacity
formulas of Table B.2 and the Enthalpy function of APEx) apply strictly to heating and cooling at
a constant pressure of 1 atm. The tabulated enthalpies and heat capacities may also be used for
nonisobaric heating and cooling of ideal or nearly ideal gases; however, at pressures high enough
(or temperatures low enough) for the gases to be far from ideal, enthalpy tables or more accurate
heat capacity formulas should be used.

The polynomial expressions forC

rougher approximate methods follow for estimating heat capacities in the absence of tabulated
formulas.
Kopp’s ruleis a simple empirical method for estimating the heat capacity of a solid or liquid
at or near 20°C. According to this rule,C
p
for a molecular compound is the sum of contributions
(given in Table B.10) for each element in the compound. For example, the heat capacity of solid

More accurate heat capacity estimation formulas for various types of gases and liquids are

Suppose you wish to calculate the enthalpy change associated with a change in temperature
undergone  by  a  mixture  of  substances.  Enthalpies  and  heat  capacities  of  certain  mixtures  are
tabulated  in  standard  references  (e.g.,  pp.  2-183  and  2-184  ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’
Handbook, Footnote 5). Lacking such data, you may use the following approximation:
Rule 1.For a mixture of gases or liquids, calculate the total enthalpy change as the sum of the
enthalpy changes for the pure mixture components.You  are  in  effect  neglecting
enthalpy changes associated with the mixing of the components, which is an excellent
approximation for mixtures of gases and for mixtures of similar liquids such as pentane
and  hexane  but  a  poor  one  for  dissimilar  liquids  such  as  nitric  acid  and  water.
Enthalpies of mixing for systems of the latter type are discussed in detail in Section 8.5.
Rule 2.For highly dilute solutions of solids or gases in liquids, neglect the enthalpy change
of the solute.The more dilute the solution, the better this approximation.
The  calculation  of  enthalpy  changes  for  the  heating  or  cooling  of  a  mixture  of  known
composition may often be simplified by calculating a heat capacity for the mixture in the following
manner:

If more than one species is involved or if there are several input or output streams instead of just
one of each, the procedure given in Section 8.1 should be followed: choose reference states for
each species, prepare andfill in a table of amounts and specific internal energies (closed system)
or speciesflow rates and specific enthalpies (open system), and substitute the calculated values
into the energy balance. The next example illustrates the procedure for a continuous heating
process.

In the last example the temperatures of all input and output streams were specified, and the only
unknown in the energy balance equation was the heat transfer rate required to achieve the specified
conditions. You will also encounter problems in which the heat input is known but the temperature of
an  output  stream  is  not.  For  these  problems,  you  must  evaluate  the  outlet  stream  component
enthalpies in terms of the unknownT, substitute the resulting expressions in the energy balance
equation, and solve forT. Example 8.3-6 illustrates this procedure.
Example 8.3-6Energy Balance on a Waste-Heat Boiler
Eliminating discharges of hot streams to the environment has two beneficial effects: the temperature of the
receiving entity (e.g., a lake, a river, or the atmosphere) is not raised, which can avoid violating an EPA
regulation,  and  the  energy  contained  in  the  discharged  stream  is  not  wasted  by  being  dissipated  in  the
environment. For example, a gas stream at 500°C containing 8.0 mol% CO and 92.0% CO
2
that was originally
going to be sent up a stack is instead sent to a heat exchanger andflows across tubes through which water is
flowing. The water enters at 25°C and is fed at a ratio of 0.200 mol water/mol hot gas, is heated to its boiling
point, and forms saturated steam at 5.0 bar. The steam may be used for heating or power generation in the
plant or as the feed to another process unit. The heat exchanger can be assumed to operate adiabatically—that
is, all heat transferred from the hot gas goes to heat the water, as opposed to some of it leaking through the heat
exchanger walls to the environment. Theflowchart for an assumed basis of 1.00 mol feed gas is shown below.
Calculate the temperature of the gas leaving the heat exchanger (a) using data from Tables B.1 and B.2 but not

ideal-gas behavior so that deviations of the pressure from 1 atm have no effect on enthalpies, and
accordingly set the inlet enthalpies of the gas species equal to zero.
We willfind the enthalpies of the feedwater and product steam in the steam tables. Knowing this, we
chose the reference state for the steam tables (liquid water at the triple point) as our reference for

8.3e  Numerical Integration of Tabulated Heat Capacities

C
p
TdT
If a functional relation forC
p
Tis available, such as one of the polynomials of Table B.2, the
integration can be carried out analytically; and if tabulated specific enthalpies are available for the
substance being heated or cooled, a simple subtraction replaces the integration.
Suppose, however, that the only information you have aboutC
p
is its value at a series of
temperatures that span the range fromT
1
toT
2
. The question is how to estimate the value of the
integral from these data.
One way would of course be to plotC
p
versusT, draw a curve by visual inspection through
the points at whichC
p
is known, and estimate the integral graphically as the area under the curve
fromT
1
toT
2
. This is a cumbersome procedure, however, even if you have access to aplanimeter,
a device that can calculate the area under a traced-out curve.
A better solution is to use one of the many existingquadrature formulas—algebraic
expressions that provide estimates of the integrals of tabulated data. Several such formulas are
presented and illustrated in Appendix A.3; the use of one of them,Simpson’srule,isrequired
for the integration of heat capacity data in several problems at the end of this chapter.

Consider liquid water and water vapor, each at 100°C and 1 atm. Which would you expect to be
greater,
^
U
liquid
or
^
U
vapor
? (Recall that
^
Uis related among other things to the energy of motion of the
individual molecules at the specified condition.)
If you said
^
U
vapor
, you would be correct. One way to think of it is that the molecules of a
vapor, which can move around relatively freely, are much more energetic than the densely packed
molecules of a liquid at the sameTandP. Also think about the fact that liquid molecules are held
in close proximity to each other by attractive forces between the molecules. The energy required to
overcome these forces when a liquid is vaporized is reflected in the higher internal energy of the
vapor molecules.
424CHAPTER 8Balances on Nonreactive Processes

Inspection of Table B.5 reveals how dramatic the difference between
^

and

U

can be.
For water at 100°C and 1 atm,

U

enthalpy (

Phase changes such as melting and evaporation are usually accompanied by large changes in
internal energy and enthalpy, as in the example just given. Heat transfer requirements in phase-
change operations consequently tend to be substantial, sinceQΔU(closed constant-volume
system) or
_
QΔ
_
H(open system). The paragraphs that follow outline procedures for setting up
and solving energy balances on such operations. The discussion will be limited to phase changes
between liquid and vapor (evaporation, condensation) and solid and liquid (melting, freezing);
however,  the  methods  may  be  extended  directly  to  other  phase  changes,  such  as  sublimation
(conversion from solid to vapor) and conversion from one solid phase to another (e.g., amorphous
to crystalline).
8.4a Latent Heats
The  specific  enthalpy  change  associated  with  the  transition  of  a  substance  from  one  phase  to
another at constant temperature and pressure is known as thelatent heatof the phase change (as
distinguished fromsensible heat, which is associated with temperature changes for a single-phase
system). For example, the specific enthalpy changeΔ
^
Hfor the transition of liquid water to steam
at 100°C and 1 atm, which equals 40.6 kJ/mol, is by definition thelatent heat of vaporization(or
simply theheat of vaporization) of water at this temperature and pressure.
Since condensation is the reverse of vaporization and enthalpy is a state property, the heat of
condensation must be the negative of the heat of vaporization. Thus, the heat of condensation of
water at 100°C and 1 atm must be40.6 kJ/mol. Similarly, the heat of solidification is the negative
of the heat of fusion at the same temperature and pressure.
Latent heats for the two most commonly encountered phase changes are defined as follows:
1.Heat of fusion(or heat of melting).Δ
^
H
m
T;Pis the specific enthalpy difference between the
solid and liquid forms of a species atTandP.
7
2.Heat of vaporization.Δ
^
H
v
T;Pis the specific enthalpy difference between the liquid and
vapor forms of a species atTandP.
Tabulated values of these two latent heats, such as those in Table B.1 and on pp. 2-144 through
2-155 ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook,(see Footnote 5) usually apply to a substance at
its normal melting or boiling point—that is, at a pressure of 1 atm. These quantities are referred to
asstandardheats of fusion and vaporization.
The standard heats of fusion and vaporization in Table B.1 may be accessed in APEx with the
following functions:

For example, if you enter=Hv(“Acetic acid”) in the cell of a spreadsheet with APEx activated, the
value 24.39 (in kJ/mol) will be returned, corresponding to the value listed in Table B.1 of the
standard heat of vaporization of acetic acid at its normal boiling point of 118°C.
The latent heat of a phase change may vary considerably with the temperature at which the
change occurs but hardly varies at all with the pressure at the transition point. For example, the
heat of vaporization of water at 25°C is 2442.5 J/g atP23:78 mm Hg and 2442.3 J/g atP
760 mm  Hg.
8
When using a tabulated latent heat, you must therefore be sure that the phase

because the latter symbol is used for theheat of formation,a quantity defined in Chapter 9.

you may ignore moderate variations in pressure.

Phase changes often occur at temperatures other than the temperature for which the latent heat
is  tabulated.  When  faced  with  this  situation,  you  must  select  a  hypothetical  process  path  that
permits the available data to be used.
Suppose, for example, that a substance is to be vaporized isothermally at 130°C, but the only
available value of the heat of vaporization is at 80°C. A process path from the liquid at 130°C to the
vapor at the same temperature must then be chosen that includes an isothermal vaporization step at
80°C: specifically, cool the liquid from 130°Cto80°C, vaporize the liquid at 80°C, and then heat
the vapor back to 130°C. Summing the changes in enthalpy for each of these steps yields the
change in enthalpy for the given process. (By definition, the calculated value is the latent heat of
vaporization at 130°C.)
Example 8.4-2Vaporization and Heating
One hundred g-moles per hour of liquidn-hexane at 25°C and 7 bar is vaporized and heated to 300°Cat
constant pressure. Neglecting the effect of pressure on enthalpy, estimate the rate at which heat must be

From  the  Antoine  equation  (Table  B.4)  or  the  APEx  function  AntoineT  (“n-hexane,”5250),  the
temperature at which the vapor pressure ofn-hexane is 7 bar (5250 mm Hg) is 146°C, and this is therefore the
temperature at which the vaporization actually occurs. However, Table B.1 lists a value ofΔ

We must thereforefind a path that takes hexane from a liquid to a vapor at 69°C, rather than at the true
vaporization temperature of 146°C.
As noted previously, the change in enthalpy associated with a process may be determined from any
convenient path as long as the initial andfinal points of the chosen path correspond to those of the process.
The diagram shown on the following page illustrates several possible paths from liquid hexane at 25°Cto
hexane vapor at 300°C.

Provided thatΔ

data, the latent heat of vaporization may be determined from a plot of lnp

versus 1=T. (See
Example 6.1-1.)
In many cases the latent heat of vaporization varies considerably with temperature, invalid-
ating  Equation  8.4-6.  It  is  then  necessary  to  use  theClapeyron equation,  from  which

The normal boiling point of methanol is 337.9 K and its critical temperature and pressure are 513.2 K and
78.5 atm. The heat of vaporization at the normal boiling point is 35.3 kJ/mol.
(a)Estimate  the  heat  of  vaporization  at  337.9 K  using  Trouton’s  rule  and  Chen’s  equation,  and
determine the percent error for each estimate.

8.4c  Energy Balances on Processes Involving Phase Changes
When writing an energy balance on a process in which a component exists in two phases, you must
choose a reference state for that component by specifying both a phase and a temperature and
calculate the specific enthalpy of the component in all process streams relative to this state. If the
substance is a liquid at its reference state and a vapor in a process stream,
^
Hmay be calculated as
outlined in Section 8.4a: that is, bring the liquid from the reference temperature to a point at which
Δ
^
H
v
is known, vaporize the liquid, bring the vapor to the process stream temperature, and sum the
individual enthalpy changes for the three steps.
Example 8.4-4Partial Vaporization of a Mixture
An equimolar liquid mixture of benzene (B) and toluene (T) at 10°C is fed continuously to a vessel in which
the mixture is heated to 50°C. The liquid product is 40.0 mole% B, and the vapor product is 68.4 mole% B.
How much heat must be transferred to the mixture per g-mole of feed?

. We do not know the feed-stream pressure and so we assume
thatΔHfor the change from 1 atm toP

low temperature or high pressure, we neglect the effects of pressure on enthalpy in the calculations of

CREATIVITY EXERCISE
A gas emerges from a stack at 1200°C. Rather than being released directly to the atmosphere, it can
be passed through one or several heat exchangers, and the heat it loses can be put to use in a variety
of ways. Think of as many uses of this heat as you can. (Example:During the winter, pass the gas
through a series of radiators, thereby getting free heating.)

8.4d  Psychrometric Charts
On apsychrometric chart(orhumidity chart) several properties of a gas–vapor mixture are
cross-plotted, providing a concise compilation of a large quantity of physical-property data. The
most common of these charts—that for the air-water system at 1 atm—is used extensively in the
analysis of humidification, drying, and air-conditioning processes.
A psychrometric chart in SI units for the air–water system at 1 atm is shown in Figure 8.4-1,
and a second chart in U.S. customary units is shown in Figure 8.4-2. Charts that cover wider
temperature ranges in several formats are given on pp. 12-7 through 12-12 ofPerry’s Chemical
Engineers’Handbook(see Footnote 5).
The following paragraphs define and describe the different properties of humid air at 1 atm
that appear on the psychrometric chart. Once you know the values of any two of these properties,
you can use the chart to determine the values of the others. We will use the abbreviation DA for
dry air.
Dry-bulb temperature,T—the abscissa of the chart. This is the air temperature as measured by
a thermometer, thermocouple, or other conventional temperature-measuring instrument.
Absolute humidity,h
a
[kg H
2
O(v)/kg DA] (calledmoisture contenton Figure 8.4-1)—the
ordinate of the chart.
This ratio can easily be calculated from or converted to the mass fraction of water. If, for
example, the absolute humidity is 0.0150 kg H
2
O/kg DA, then for every kilogram of dry air
there is 0.015 kg of water vapor, for a total of 1.015 kg. The mass fraction of water is (0.0150 kg
H
2
O)/(1.015 kg humid air)=0.0148 kg H

O/kg.

Curves on the psychrometric chart correspond to specified values ofh
r
(100%, 90%, 80%,
etc.).  The  curve  that  forms  the  left  boundary  of  the  chart  corresponds  to100% relative
humidityand is known as thesaturation curve.
Dew point,T
dp
—the  temperature  at  which  humid  air  becomes  saturated  if  it  is  cooled  at
constant pressure.
The dew point of humid air at a given  point on the  psychrometric chart can easily be
determined. For example, locate the point on Figure 8.4-1 corresponding to air at 29°C and 20%
relative  humidity.  Cooling  this  air  at  constant  pressure  (1 atm)  corresponds  to  moving
horizontally (at constant absolute humidity) to the saturation curve.T
dp
is the temperature at the
intersection, or 4°C. (Verify this statement.)
Humid volume,
^
V
H
(m
3
/kg DA).
The humid volume is the volume occupied by 1 kg of dry air plus the water vapor that
accompanies it. Lines of constant humid volume on the psychrometric chart are steep and have
negative slopes. On Figure 8.4-1, humid-volume lines are shown corresponding to 0.75, 0.80,
0.85, and 0.90 m
3
/kg dry air.
To determine the volume of a given mass of wet air using the psychrometric chart, you
mustfirst  determine  the  corresponding  mass  of  dry  air  from  the  absolute  humidity,  then
multiply this mass by
^
V
H
. Suppose, for example, you wish to know the volume occupied by
150 kg of humid air atT30°C andh

(In this calculation, we used the fact that if the absolute humidity is 0.008 kg H

O/kg DA, then
1 kg DA is accompanied by 0.008 kg water for a total of 1.008 kg humid air.)

Wet-bulb temperature,T
wb
.
This quantity is best defined in terms of how it is measured. A porous material such as cloth
or cotton is soaked in water and wrapped around the bulb of a thermometer to form awick, and
the thermometer is placed in a stream offlowing air, as in thefigure shown below.
9
Evaporation
of water from the wick into theflowing air is accompanied by a transfer of heat from the bulb,
which in turn causes a drop in the bulb temperature and hence in the thermometer reading.
10
Provided that the wick remains moist, the bulb temperature falls to a certain value and remains
there. Thefinal temperature reading is the wet-bulb temperature of the airflowing past the wick.

The wet-bulb temperature of humid air depends on both the dry-bulb temperature and the
moisture content of the air. If the air is saturated (100% relative humidity), no water evaporates
from  the  wick,  and  the  wet-bulb  and  dry-bulb  temperatures  are  the  same.  The  lower  the
humidity, the greater the difference between the two temperatures.
The humid air conditions that correspond to a given wet-bulb temperature fall on a straight
line on the psychrometric chart, called aconstant wet-bulb temperature line. The constant
wet-bulb temperature lines for air–water at 1 atm appear on Figures 8.4-1 and 8.4-2 as lines
with negative slopes extending beyond the saturation curve that are less steep than the lines of
constant humid volume. The value ofT
wb
corresponding to a given line can be read at the
intersection of the line with the saturation curve.
For example, suppose you wish to determine the wet-bulb temperature of air at 30°C(drybulb)
with a relative humidity of 30%. Locate the point on Figure 8.4-1 at the intersection of the vertical
line corresponding toT30°C and the curve corresponding toh
r
30%. The diagonal line
through the point is the constant wet-bulb temperature line for air at the given condition. Follow
that line upward to the left until you reach the saturation curve. The temperature value you readon
the curve (or vertically down from it on the abscissa) is the wet-bulb temperature of the air. You
should get a value of 18°C. This means that if you wrap a wet wick around a thermometer bulb and
blow air withT30°Candh
r
30%past the bulb, the thermometer reading will drop and
eventually stabilize at 18°C.
Specific enthalpy of saturated air
The  diagonal  scale  above  the  saturation  curve  on  the  psychrometric  chart  shows  the
enthalpy of a unit mass (1 kg or 1 lb
m
) of dry air plus the water vapor it contains at saturation.
The reference states are liquid water at 1 atm and 0°C (32°F) and dry air at 1 atm and 0°C
(Figure  8.4-1)  or  0°F  (Figure  8.4-2).  To  determine  the  enthalpy  from  the  chart,  follow  the
constant wet-bulb temperature line from the saturation curve at the desired temperature up to
the enthalpy scale.
9
Alternatively, the thermometer may be mounted in asling psychrometerand whirled around in stationary air.
10
Think about what happens when you step out of a shower or swimming pool. Water evaporates, your skin temperature
drops, and you feel cold, even if you felt perfectly comfortable when you were dry.

Enthalpy deviation
The remaining curves on the psychrometric chart are almost vertical and convex to the left,
with labeled values (on Figure 8.4-1) of0.05,0.1,0.2, and so on. (The units of these
numbers are kJ/kg DA). These curves are used to determine the enthalpy of humid air that is not
saturated. The procedure is as follows: (a) locate the point on the chart corresponding to air at its
specified condition; (b) interpolate to estimate the enthalpy deviation at this point; (c) follow
the constant wet-bulb temperature line to the enthalpy scale above the saturation curve, read the
value on that scale, and add the enthalpy deviation to it.
For example, air at 35°C and 10% relative humidity has an enthalpy deviation of about
0.52 kJ/kg DA. The specific enthalpy of saturated air at the same wet-bulb temperature is
45.0 kJ/kg DA. (Verify both of these numbers.) The specific enthalpy of the humid air at the
given condition is therefore (45.00.52) kJ/kg DA44:5 kJ/kg DA.
The  basis  for   the   construction   of  the   psychrometric   chart   is  the   Gibbs   phase   rule
(Section 6.3a), which states that specifying a certain number of the intensive variables (tempera-
ture, pressure, specific volume, specific enthalpy, component mass or mole fractions, etc.) of a
system automaticallyfixes the value of the remaining intensive variables. Humid air contains one
phase and two components,
11
so that from Equation 6.2-1 the number of degrees of freedom is
F2213
Specifying  three  intensive  variables  thereforefixes  all  other  system  properties.  If  the  system
pressure isfixed at 1 atm, then all other properties may be plotted on a two-dimensional plot, such
as those shown in Figures 8.4-1 and 8.4-2.
Example 8.4-5The Psychrometric Chart
Use the psychrometric chart to estimate (1) the absolute humidity, wet-bulb temperature, humid volume, dew
point, and specific enthalpy of humid air at 41°C and 10% relative humidity, and (2) the amount of water in
150 m
3
of air at these conditions.
11
Since the components of dry air do not condense and are present infixed proportion, dry air may be considered a single
species (designated DA) in humidity calculations.

The psychrometric chart can be used to simplify the solution of material and energy balance
problems  for  constant-pressure air–water  systems, at the  expense  of some precision.  Note the
following points:
1.Heating or cooling humid air at temperatures above the dew point corresponds to horizontal
movement on the psychrometric chart. The ordinate on the chart is the ratio kg H
2
O/kg dry air,
which does not change as long as no condensation occurs.
2.If superheated humid air is cooled at 1 atm, the system follows a horizontal path to the left on
the chart until the saturation curve (dew point) is reached; thereafter, the gas phase follows the
saturation curve.
8.4  Phase-Change Operations437

3.Since  the  psychrometric  chart  plots the  mass  ratio  kg  H
2
O/kg  dry air  rather  than  the  mass
fraction of water, it is usually convenient to assume a quantity of dry air in a feed or product
stream as a basis of calculation if the chart is to be used in the solution.
Example 8.4-6Material and Energy Balances on an Air Conditioner
Air at 80°F and 80% relative humidity is cooled to 51°F at a constant pressure of 1 atm. Use the psychrometric

CREATIVITY EXERCISE
In home air-conditioning systems, the controlling thermostat is set to the desired room temperature
T
1
, and the AC unit typically cools air passing through it to a temperatureT
2
significantly lower
thanT
1
. Give at least two reasons why.
8.4e  Adiabatic Cooling
Inadiabatic cooling, a warm gas is brought into contact with a cold liquid, causing the gas to cool
and some of the liquid to evaporate. Heat is transferred from the gas to the liquid but no heat is
transferred between the gas–liquid system and its surroundings (hence“adiabatic”cooling). Some
common processes of this type are described below.
Spray cooling, spray humidification.Liquid  water  is  sprayed  into  a  relatively  dry  warm
stream  of  air.  Some  of  the  water  evaporates,  and  the  temperature  of  the  air  and  of  the
unevaporated liquid both decrease. If the object is to cool the water or the air, the operation is
called spray cooling; if the point is to increase the moisture content of the air, the operation is
spray humidification.
13
Spray dehumidification.Warm  humid  air  isdehumidified  by  spraying  cold  water  into  it.
Provided  that  the  liquid  temperature  is  low  enough,  the  air  is  cooled  below  its  dew  point,
causing some of the water vapor in it to condense.
Drying.Hot air is blown over wet solids—for example, over a wet cake deposited in afilter or
centrifuge. The water evaporates, leaving a dry solid product. Drying is the last step in the
production  of  most crystalline  products  and powders,  including  many  pharmaceuticals  and
food products.
Spray drying.A suspension of small solid particles in water is sprayed as afine mist into a
stream  of  hot  air.  The  water  evaporates,  larger  solid  particles  settle  out  of  the  air  and  are
removed by a conveyor, andfine suspended particles are separated from the air by a bagfilter or
cyclone separator. Dried milk is produced in this manner.
Writing material and energy balances on an adiabatic cooling operation is a straightforward
but cumbersome procedure. It can be shown, however, that if certain well-justified assumptions
are made (we will state them later),air undergoing adiabatic cooling through contact with liquid
water moves along a constant wet-bulb temperature line on the psychrometric chart from its
initial condition to the 100% relative humidity curve. Further cooling of the air below its saturation
temperature leads to condensation and hence dehumidification.

the initial state (or on the 100% humidity curve if cooling below theadiabatic saturation

humidification operation.
Example 8.4-7Adiabatic Humidification
A stream of air at 30°C and 10% relative humidity is humidified in an adiabatic spray tower operating at

SolutionWe  assume  that  the  heat  required  to  raise  the  temperature  of  the  liquid  in  the  spray  tower  is  negligible
compared with the heat of vaporization of water, so that the air follows an adiabatic saturation curve (constant

The outlet temperature and humidity determined in this manner are represented by a point

defines a curve on the chart, known as theadiabatic saturation curve.If the
three stated assumptions are valid, thefinal state of air undergoing an adiabatic humidifica-
tion must lie on the adiabatic saturation curve that passes through the inlet state on the
psychrometric chart.
If  the  outlet  temperatureT

is  low  enough,  the  air  leaves  saturated  with  water.  The
temperature corresponding to this condition is the adiabatic saturation temperature and is found
at the intersection of the adiabatic saturation curve with the 100% relative humidity curve.

The  psychrometric  chart  for  most  gas–liquid  systems  would  show  a  family  of  adiabatic
saturation curves in addition to the families of curves shown on Figures 8.4-1 and 8.4-2. However,
for the air–water system at 1 atm, the adiabatic saturation curve through a given state coincides
with the constant wet-bulb temperature line through that state, so that T

material and energy balance procedure for adiabatic cooling outlined in this section is possible
only because of this coincidence.

1. (a)Under what conditions do the temperature and humidity of a gas undergoing adiabatic
cooling follow a unique curve on the psychrometric chart, regardless of the entering
liquid temperature?
(b)Does this curve coincide with a constant wet-bulb temperature line if the gas is air and
the liquid is water?
(c)What if they were nitrogen and acetone?
2.Air at 26°C with a relative  humidity of 10% undergoes an adiabatic humidification. Use
Figure 8.4-1 to estimate the adiabatic saturation temperature of the air. If the exiting air has a
dry-bulb  temperature  of  14°C,  determine  its  absolute  humidity,  relative  humidity,  and
specific enthalpy.
8.5MIXING AND SOLUTION
You may have carried out an experiment in a chemistry laboratory in which you mixed two liquids
(such as concentrated sulfuric acid and water) or dissolved a solid in a liquid (such as sodium hydroxide
in water) and observed that the mixture or solution became quite hot. The question is: Why?
When two different liquids are mixed or when a gas or solid is dissolved in a liquid, bonds are
broken between neighboring molecules—and possibly between atoms—of the feed materials, and
new bonds are formed between neighboring molecules or ions in the product solution. If less
energy is required to break the bonds in the feed materials than is released when the solution bonds
form, a net release of energy results. Unless this energy is transferred from the solution to its
surroundings as heat, it goes into raising the solution temperature, which is what happened in the
experiments described in thefirst paragraph.
Suppose you mix 1 mol of pure liquid sulfuric acid with water at a specified temperature and
pressure and then cool the mixture at constant pressure to bring it back to the initial temperature.
The energy balance for this constant-pressure process is

whereΔH—the difference between the enthalpy of the solution at the specified temperature and
pressure and the total enthalpy of the pure solute and solvent at the sameTandP—is theheat of
solutionat that  temperature  and  pressure. For  the  sulfuric  acid  dilution,  we  knowQ<0  (the
container  must be  cooled  to keep  the  solution  temperature from  rising)  and  so it  follows that
ΔH—the heat of solution—is negative for this process.

have assumed ideal-mixture behavior for all mixtures and solutions. This assumption works well
for nearly all gas mixtures and for liquid mixtures of similar compounds (such as mixtures of
paraffins or of aromatics), but for other mixtures and solutions—such as aqueous solutions of
strong  acids  or  bases  or  certain  gases  (such  as  hydrogen  chloride)  or  solids  (such  as  sodium
hydroxide)—heats of solution should be included in energy balance calculations. This section
outlines the required procedures.

approaches  a  limiting  value  known  as  theheat of solution at infinite
dilution. Theheat of mixinghas the same meaning as the heat of solution when the process
involves mixing twofluids rather than dissolving a gas or solid in a liquid.
Perry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see Footnote 5) on pp. 2-203 through 2-206 gives
heats of solution of various substances in water at either 18°Cor“room temperature,”which is
roughly 25°C.Caution:The values given in theHandbookare evolved heats and thus negatives of

As an illustration of how to use these data, suppose you wish to calculateΔHfor a process in
which 2 mol of potassium cyanide (KCN) is dissolved in 400 mol of water at 18°C. First, calculate
the moles of solvent per mole of solute:
r400=2200 mol H

The  value  ofΔH

Table B.11 may be used to determine directly the specific enthalpies of solutions at 25°C relative
to the pure solute and solvent at this temperature. Another common choice of reference conditions,
however, is the pure solvent and an infinitely dilute solution at 25°C.
Consider, for example, a hydrochloric acid solution for whichr10 moles H

8.5b Balances on Dissolution and Mixing Processes
When setting up an energy balance on a process that involves forming, concentrating, or diluting a
solution for which the heat of solution or mixing cannot be neglected, prepare an inlet–outlet
enthalpy table considering the solution as a single substance and the pure components at 25°Cas
reference states. To calculate the enthalpy of the solution at a temperatureT≠25°C,first calculate
its enthalpy at 25°C from tabulated heat of solution data, then add the enthalpy change for the
heating or cooling of the solution from 25°CtoT. The enthalpy change for the latter step should
be calculated from tabulated solution heat capacities if they are available [e.g., if they are listed on
pp. 2-183 and 2-184 ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook(see Footnote 5)]; otherwise, use
the  average  heat  capacity  determined  using  Equation  8.3-13  for  liquid  mixtures  or  the  heat
capacity of the pure solvent for dilute solutions.

8.5c Enthalpy–Concentration Charts—Single Liquid Phase
Energy balance calculations on liquid-phase systems involving mixtures can be cumbersome
when  heats  of  mixing  are  significant.  The  calculations  can  be  simplified  for  binary  (two-
component)  systems  by  using anenthalpy–concentration chart,  a plot  of  specific  enthalpy
versus mole fraction (or mole percent) or mass fraction (or weight percent) of one component. An
^
H-xchart for aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid at several temperatures is shown in Figure 8.5-1.
The reference conditions for the plotted enthalpies are pure liquid H
2
SO
4
at 77°F and liquid water
at 32°F.
The points on the isotherms of Figure 8.5-1 weredetermined using the procedure outlined in
the last section. Suppose, for example, you wish to calculate the specific enthalpy (Btu/lb
m
)ofa
40 wt% sulfuric acid solution at 120°F. If you know the heat of mixing of sulfuric acid at 77°F, the
process path you would follow would be to bring pure liquid water from its reference temperature
of 32°Fto77°F (the sulfuric acid starts at 77°F and so does not require this step), mix the two
liquids at 77°F, bring the product solution to 120°F, and calculate and add the enthalpy changes
for each of these steps.

Compare the ease of this computation with that of Example 8.5-1. Having the enthalpy–concentration
chart eliminates the need for all of the hypothetical heating, cooling, and isothermal mixing steps that would
normally be required to evaluate the total enthalpy change for the process.

8.5d Using Enthalpy–Concentration Charts for Vapor–Liquid
Equilibrium Calculations
Enthalpy–concentration charts are particularly useful for two-component systems in which vapor
and liquid phases are in equilibrium. The Gibbs phase rule (Equation 6.2-1) specifies that such a
system  has2222  degrees  of  freedom.  If  as  before  wefix  the  system  pressure,  then
specifying only one more intensive variable—the system temperature, or the mass or mole fraction
of  either  component  in  either  phase—fixes  the  values  of  all  other  intensive  variables  in  both
phases. An
^
H-xdiagram for the ammonia–water system at 1 atm is shown in Figure 8.5-2. The
specific  enthalpies  of  aqueous  solutions  and  gaseous  mixtures  of  ammonia  and  water  in
equilibrium with each other are shown on the two curves on thisfigure. Each phase is said to
besaturated.
Suppose the mass fraction of ammonia in a saturated liquid solution of NH
3
and H
2
O at 1 atm
is specified to be 0.25. According to the phase rule, the system temperature and the mass fraction
of NH
3
in the vapor phase are uniquely determined by these specifications. (Verify.)Atie linemay
therefore be drawn on the enthalpy–concentration chart fromx0:25 on the liquid-phase curve to
the corresponding point on the vapor-phase curve, which experimental data have shown to be at

constructed  in  this  manner  are  shown  in  Figure  8.5-2;  once  drawn,  the  lines  may  be  used  to
determine  the  equilibrium  composition  and  the  specific  enthalpy  of  each  phase  at  a  specified
temperature.
Example 8.5-4Use of the Enthalpy–Concentration Chart for a Two-Phase System
An aqueous ammonia solution is in equilibrium with a vapor phase in a closed system at 160°F and 1 atm. The
liquid phase accounts for 95% of the total mass of the system contents. Use Figure 8.5-2 to determine the
weight percent of NH
3
in each phase and the enthalpy of the system per unit mass of the system contents.
SolutionThe mass fractions of ammonia and specific enthalpies of each phase may be read from the intersections of the
160°F tie line with the vapor and liquid equilibrium curves on Figure 8.5-2.

If the overall composition of a two-phase two-component system at a given temperature and
pressure is known, the fraction of the system that is liquid or vapor may easily be determined from
the enthalpy–concentration chart.
Suppose, for example, that a mixture of ammonia and water that is 40% NH
3
by mass is
contained  in  a  closed  vessel  at  140°F  and  1 atm.  PointAon  Figure  8.5-2  corresponds  to  this
condition.  Since  this  point  lies  between  the  vapor  and  liquid  equilibrium  curves,  the  mixture
separates into two phases whose compositions are found at the extremities of the 140°F tie line
(pointsBandC).
In general, ifF,L,andVare the total mass of the mixture, the mass of the liquid phase and
the mass of the vapor phase, respectively, andx

From the properties of similartriangles, the right side of Equation 8.5-6 equals the ratio of

Once you have located the total mixture on the chart from a specified set of feed conditions, it
becomes a simple matter to determine the compositions, enthalpies, and relative proportions of
each phase, calculations that would take much more time in the absence of the chart.

^
Hare  respectively  the  specific
internal energy and specific enthalpy of a species in a process state
relative to a specified reference state for the same species.
This chapter presents formulas and methods for evaluating
^
U
and
^
H(and  henceΔU,ΔH,  andΔ
_
H)  when  tables  of  internal
energies  and  enthalpies  are  not  readily  available.  Here  is  the
general procedure:
1.Choose a reference state (phase, temperature, and pressure) for
each species involved in a process.
2.Choose a path from the reference state to each initial andfinal
(or inlet and outlet) process state for each species, and evaluate
^
U
i
(or
^
H
i
)asΔ
^
U(orΔ
^
H) for the transition from the reference
state to the process state.
3.Once all of the

(or all
^

) values are determined in this manner
and all of then
i
(or all
_
n
i
) values are determined from material
balances, densities or equations of state, and phase equilibrium
relations, calculateΔU,ΔH,orΔ
_
Hand substitute the result in
the energy balance to determine whichever variable is unknown
(usually the heat,Q, or heat transfer rate,
_
Q).
Following  are  points  regarding  the  implementation  of  this
procedure  for  various  types  of  processes.  Each  step  can  be
conveniently carried out on a spreadsheet.
Energy  balance  calculations  for  a  system  (a  process  unit  or
combination of units) are conveniently organized through the
construction of aninlet–outlet internal energy table(orenthalpy
table). The table listsn(or
_
n)and
^
U(or
^
H) for each species at
each state (phase, temperature, pressure) in which the species is
found in process streams. Once all of these variable values have
been  determined  and  inserted  in  the  table,  the  subsequent
evaluation ofΔU,ΔH,orΔ
_
His straightforward.
The fact that internal energy and enthalpy arestate properties
means that any convenient process path from a reference state
to a  process state  may be  chosen, even  if the actual  process
454CHAPTER 8Balances on Nonreactive Processes

proceeds by a different path. As a rule, you would choose a path
that allows you to make use of heat capacities, phase transition
temperatures, and latent heats tabulated in an available refer-
ence (such as this text).

of  the  enthalpies  of  the  pure  solution  components  at  the

instead of being pleased he was horrified.
“Have you lost your mind, Josephine?”he sputtered.“It will cost a fortune to keep this thing hot,
and you know what the President said about conserving energy.”
“Don’t be silly, Ralph,”she replied.“It can’t cost more than a few pennies a day, even in the dead
of winter.”
“No way—just because you have a PhD, you think you’re an expert on everything!”
They argued for a while, bringing up several issues that each had been storing for just such an

(i.e., you) had a chemical engineering education and came to ask if you could settle their argument.
You asked a few questions, made several observations, converted everything to metric units, and
arrived at the following data, all corresponding to an average outside temperature of 5°C.
The tub holds 1230 liters of water.
Ralph normally keeps the tub temperature at 29°C, raises it to 40°C when he plans to use it, keeps it
at 40°C for about one hour, and drops it back to 29°C when he isfinished.
During heating, it takes about three hours for the water temperature to rise from 29°Cto40°C.
When the heat is shut off, it takes eight hours for the water temperature to drop back to 29°C.

In the illustration shown below, a suspension of gold nanoparticles of a fairly uniform size in water
exhibits peak absorption near a wavelength of 525 nm (near the blue region of the visible spectrum of
light). When one views the solution in ambient (white) light, the solution appears wine-red because the
blue part of the spectrum is largely absorbed. When the nanoparticles aggregate to form large particles,
an optical absorption peak near 600–700 nm (near the red region of the visible spectrum) is observed.
The breadth of the peak reflects a fairly broad particle size distribution. The solution appears bluish

Since the optical properties of metallic nanoparticles are a strong function of their size, achieving a
narrow particle size distribution is an important step in the development of nanoparticle applications. A
promising way to do so islaser photolysis, in which a suspension of particles of several different sizes is
irradiated with a high-intensity laser pulse. By carefully selecting the wavelength and energy of the pulse
to match an absorption peak of one of the particle sizes (e.g., irradiating the red solution in the diagram
with a 525 nm laser pulse), particles of or near that size can be selectively vaporized.
(a)A spherical silver nanoparticle of diameterDat 25°C is to be heated to its normal boiling point and
vaporized with a pulsed laser. Considering the particle a closed system at constant pressure, write
the energy balance for this process, look up the physical properties of silver that are required in the
energy balance, and perform all the required substitutions and integrations to derive an expression
for the energyQ

is a barrier to water movement. Such a structure was planned for the Fukushima TEPCO nuclear
power  plant,  which  was  severely  damaged  by  a  2011  tsunami  that  created  a  tremendous
environmental challenge. A major concern was potential contamination with radioactive isotopes
of groundwaterflowing under the plant and into the ocean. A proposal under consideration was to
channel theflow around the plant by forming an ice dam with a 1,400-meter perimeter, a depth of
30 m, and a thickness of approximately 2 m. This was to be done by pumping a brine solution at a
temperature of40°C though vertical pipes spaced at 1-m intervals. The brine would exit at a
temperature  no  greater  than25°C.  To  keep  ambient  temperaturefluctuations  from  causing
occasional melting, the dam was to have a mean temperature of about20°C.

Ever wonder why espresso costs much more per cup than regular drip coffee? Part of the reason is the
expensive equipment needed to brew a proper espresso. A high-powered burr grinderfirst shears the
coffee beans to afine powder without producing too much heat. (Heating the coffee in the grinding
stage prematurely releases the volatile oils that give espresso its richflavor and aroma.) The ground
coffee is put into a cylindrical container called agruppaand tamped downfirmly to provide an even
flow of water through it. An electrically heated boiler inside the espresso machine maintains water in a
reservoir at 1.4 bar and 109°C. An electric pump takes cold water at 15°C and 1 bar, raises its pressure
to  slightly  above  9 bar,  and  feeds  it  into  a  heating  coil  that  passes  through  the  reservoir.  Heat
transferred from the reservoir through the coil wall raises the water temperature to 96°C. The heated
waterflows into the top of the gruppa at 96°C and 9 bar, passes slowly through the tightly packed
ground beans, and dissolves the oils and some of the solids in the beans to become espresso, which
decompresses to 1 atm as it exits the machine. The water temperature and uniformflow through the
bed of packed coffee in the gruppa lead to the more intenseflavor of espresso relative to normal drip
coffee. Water drawn directly from the reservoir is expanded to atmospheric pressure where it forms
steam, which is used to heat and froth milk for lattes and cappuccinos.
(a)Sketch this process, using blocks to represent the pump, reservoir, and gruppa. Label all heat and
workflows in the process, including electrical energy.
(b)To make a 14-oz latte, you would steam 12 ounces of cold milk (3°C) until it reaches 71°C and
pour it over 2 ounces of espresso. Assume that the steam cools but none of it condenses as it
bubbles through the milk. For each latte made, the heating element that maintains the reservoir
temperature must supply enough energy to heat the espresso water plus enough to heat the milk,
plus additional energy. Assuming

phenomena.

(c)Coffee beans contain a considerable amount of trapped carbon dioxide, not all of which is released
when the beans are ground. When the hot pressurized water percolates through the ground beans,
some  of  the  carbon  dioxide  is  absorbed  in  the  liquid.  When  the  liquid  is  then  dispensed  at
atmospheric pressure,fine CO
2
bubbles come out of solution. In addition, one of the chemical
compounds  formed  when  the  coffee  beans  are  roasted  and  extracted  into  the  espresso  is
melanoidin, asurfactant. Surfactant molecules are asymmetrical, with one end beinghydrophilic
(drawn to water) and the other endhydrophobic(repelled by water). When the bubbles (thin water
films containing CO
2
) pass through the espresso liquid, the hydrophilic ends of the melanoidin
molecules attach to the bubbles and the dissolved bean oils in turn attach to the hydrophobic ends.
The result is that the bubbles emerge coated with the oils to form thecrema, the familiar reddish-
brown stable foam at the surface of good espresso. Speculate on why you don’t see crema in
normal drip coffee. (Hint:Henry’s law should show up in your explanation.)Note:All soaps and
shampoos contain at least one surfactant species. (A common one is sodium lauryl sulfate.) Its
presence explains why if you have greasy hands, washing with plain water may leave the grease
untouched but washing with soap removes the grease.
(d)Explain in your own words (i) how espresso is made, (ii) why espresso has a moreintense
flavor than regular drip coffee, (iii) what the crema in espresso is, how it forms, and why it
doesn’t appear in regular drip coffee, and (iv) why washing with plain water does not remove
grease  but  washing  with  soap  does.  (Note:Many  people  automatically  assume  that  all
chemical engineers are extraordinarily intelligent. If you can explain those four things, you
can help perpetuate that belief.)

Polyvinylpyrrolidone  (PVP)  is  a  polymer  product  used  as  a  binding  agent  in  pharmaceutical
applications  as  well  as  in  personal-care  items  such  as  hairspray.  In  the  manufacture  of  PVP,  a
spray-drying  process  is  used  to  collect  solid  PVP  from  an  aqueous  suspension,  as  shown  in  the

relative humidity of the exiting air. Assume that the polymer has a heat capacity per unit mass one-

(c)Why do you think the polymer solution is put through an atomizing nozzle, which converts it to a
mist of tiny droplets, rather than being sprayed through a much less costly nozzle of the type
commonly found in showers?
(d)Due to a designflaw, the polymer solution does not remain in the dryer long enough for all the
water to evaporate, so the solid product emerging from the separator is a wet powder. How will
this  change  the  values  of  the  outlet  temperatures  of  the  emerging  gas  and  powder  and  the

8.47.Benzene vapor at 480°C is cooled and converted to a liquid at 25°C in a continuous condenser. The
condensate is drained into 1.75-m
3
drums, each of which takes 2.0 minutes tofill. Calculate the rate
(kW) at which heat is transferred from the benzene in the condenser.
8.48.In gas adsorption a vapor is transferred from a gas mixture to the surface of a solid. (See Section 6.7.)
An approximate but useful way of analyzing adsorption is to treat it simply as condensation of vapor
on a solid surface.
Suppose a nitrogen stream at 35°C and 1 atm containing carbon tetrachloride with a 15% relative
saturation is fed at a rate of 10.0 mol/min to a 6-kg bed of activated carbon. The temperature and
pressure of the gas do not change appreciably from the inlet to the outlet of the bed, and there is no
CCl
4
in  the  gas  leaving  the  adsorber.  The  carbon  can  adsorb  40%  of  its  own  mass  of  carbon
tetrachloride before becoming saturated, at which point it must be either regenerated (remove the
carbon  tetrachloride)  or  replaced  with  a  fresh  bed  of  activated  carbon.  Neglect  the  effect  of
temperature on the heat of vaporization of CCl
4
when solving the following problems:
(a)Estimate the rate (kJ/min) at which heat must be removed from the adsorber to keep the process
isothermal, and the time (min) it will take to saturate the bed.
(b)The surface-to-volume ratio of spherical particles is (3/r)(cm
2
outer surface)/(cm
3
volume).
First, derive that formula. Second, use it to explain how decreasing the average diameter of
the particles in the carbon bed might make the adsorption process more efficient. Third, since
most  of  the  area  on  which  adsorption  takes  place  is  provided  by  pores  penetrating  the
particle,  explain  why  the  surface-to-volume  ratio,  as  calculated  by  the  above  expression,
might be relatively unimportant.

Fish and wildlife managers have determined that a sudden temperature increase greater than 5°C
would be harmful to the marine ecosystem of a river. Warmer waters contain less dissolved oxygen
and cause organisms in a river to increase their metabolism; if the temperature increase is sudden, the
organisms do not have time to adapt to the new environment and likely will die. (Changes in river
temperatures offive degrees and more due to seasonal temperature variations are common, but those
temperature changes are gradual.)
A proposed chemical plant plans to use river water for process cooling. The riverflows at a rate
of 15.0 m
3
/s at a temperature of 15°C, and a fraction of it will be diverted to the plant. Preliminary
calculations reveal that the cooling water will remove 5.00×10
5
kJ/s of heat from the plant. A portion
of the extracted water will evaporate from the plant into the atmosphere, and the remainder will be
returned to the river at a temperature of 35°C.

available to calculate all of the unknown streamflow rates on the chart.
(b)Estimate the fraction of the riverflow that must be diverted to the plant and the percentage of the
cooling water that evaporates. Assume that water has a constant heat capacity of 4.19 kJ/(kg°C)
and a heat of vaporization roughly that of water at the normal boiling point, and also assume that
the  specific  enthalpy  of  the  water  vapor  relative  to  liquid  water  at  15°C  equals  the  heat  of
vaporization.
(c)Write (but don’t evaluate) an expression for the enthalpy change neglected by the assumption
about the specific enthalpy of the steam.
8.67.An aqueous slurry at 30°C containing 20.0 wt% solids is fed to an evaporator in which enough water is

evaporator by feeding saturated steam at 2.6 bar absolute into a coil immersed in the liquid. The steam
condenses in the coil, and the slurry boils at the normal boiling point of pure water. The heat capacity
of the solids may be taken to be half that of liquid water.

Seawater enters thefirst effect at 300 K at a rate of 5000 kg/h, and saturated steam at 4.00 bar
absolute  is  fed  into  a  tube  bundle  in  thefirst  effect.  The  steam  condenses  at  4.00 bar,  and  the
condensate is withdrawn at the saturation temperature corresponding to this pressure.
The heat given up by the steam condensing in the tubes causes water to evaporate from the brine
solution at the pressure of 0.60 bar maintained in the effect. The exiting brine contains 5.5 wt% salt.
The steam generated in thefirst effect is fed to a tube bundle in the second effect. The condensate from
the bundle and the steam generated in the second effect at a pressure of 0.20 bar constitute the fresh
water produced in the process.
In solving the problems to be given, assume that the brine solutions in both effects have the
physical properties of pure water and that the effects operate adiabatically.
(a)Draw and label aflowchart of this process, giving the temperature and specific enthalpy of each
stream.
(b)At what rate must steam be fed to thefirst effect?
(c)What is the production rate of fresh water? What is the salt concentration (weight percent) of the
final brine solution? Why is it inappropriate to add the condensate from thefirst effect to the
production rate of fresh water?
(d)Why is it necessary that the pressure decrease from one effect to the next?
(e)Suppose a single-effect evaporator were used, operating atP0:20 bar. Calculate the feed rate of
saturated steam atP4:00 bar that would be required to achieve the same production rate of
fresh water. What more would you need to know to determine which process is more economical?
8.70.Seawater containing 3.5 wt% dissolved salts is to be desalinated in an adiabatic six-effect evaporator.
(See Problem 8.69.) Backward feed is  to be used: the seawater  is fed to the last evaporator,  and
successively concentrated brine solutionsflow countercurrent to the direction offlow of steam from
one effect to the next. Saturated steam atP2 bar is fed to the tube bundle in thefirst effect. The

8.72.A small pharmaceuticalfirm plans to manufacture a new drug and has hired you as a consultant to
design  a  condenser  to  remove  the  drug  from  a  gas–vapor  mixture.  The  mixture,  which  contains
20 mole% of the drug and the balance nitrogen, will be fed to the condenser at 510 K and 1 atm at a rate
of 3.5 L/s. Of the drug fed to the unit, 90% must be condensed. No physical property data are available
for the drug, and part of your job is to acquire the data needed to design the condenser. The company
has sent you a large sample of the liquid drug for this purpose.
You  acquire  an  insulated  2.000-liter  container  with  a  known  heat  capacity  and  a  built-in
electrical heating coil that can deliver a known heat input to the contents of the container. A calibrated
thermocouple is used to measure the temperature in the vessel, and the pressure is measured with a
mercury manometer.
You carry out a series of experiments on a day when atmospheric pressure is 763 mm Hg.

8.73. Freeze dryingis a technique for dehydrating substances at low temperatures, thereby avoiding the
degradation that may accompany heating. The material to be dried is cooled to a temperature at which
all of the water present turns to ice. The frozen substance is then placed in a vacuum chamber and may
also be subjected to radiant or microwave heating; the ice in the food sublimes, and the vapor is carried
off by the vacuum pump.
Steaks are to be freeze-dried in a heated chamber at 1 torr (1 mm Hg). The steaks, which contain
72% water by mass, enter the chamber at26°C at a rate of 50 kg/min. Of the water entering with the
steaks, 96% leaves as a vapor at 60°C; the remainder leaves as a liquid with the steaks at 50°C.

required heat input in kilowatts.

(b)When  large  temperature  changes  are  not  involved  in  a  phase-change  operation,  a  reasonable
estimate  of  the  required  heat  transfer  rate  may  be  obtained  by  neglecting  contributions  of
temperature changes to the overall process enthalpy change (i.e., by taking only phase changes
into  account).  Moreover,  it  is  often  reasonable  to  use  any  available  values  of  latent  heats,
neglecting their dependence on temperature and pressure. In the case of the freeze-drying process,
the approximation might be to calculate only the heat needed to melt all the water and vaporize
96% of it, using latent heats at the normal melting and boiling points (Table B.1) and neglecting
the heat required to raise the temperature of the meat and water. What percentage error in the
calculated value of
_
Qwould result from this approximation? Take the value determined in Part (a)
to be exact.
(c)Many substances, such as food and drugs, spoil if exposed too long to high temperatures (which
accelerate rates of degradation) or to liquid water (which provides an environment for growth of
microbial species that cause degradation). Also, rates of evaporation and sublimation increase as

temperature  increases  and  pressure  decreases.  Use  those  observations  to  construct  a  one-
paragraph explanation of how freeze-drying works and the reason for each step of the process.
(For example, why is the sublimation done in a vacuum chamber?) Your explanation should be
clear to someone with a nontechnical or nonscientific background.

The manufacturers of a new oatmeal product want to determine the least expensive way to safeguard
and transport their product. They chooselyophilization(freeze drying), which removes most of the
water from the product, making it lighter and therefore less costly to transport over long distances, and
substantially increases its shelf life. Lyophilization also removes some of the impurities introduced by
industrial farming methods.
A  solid  feed  stream  containing  70.0 wt%  oatmeal,  27%  water  (ice),  and  the  balance  organic
impurities enters a heated vacuum chamber at a rate of 1.0×10
3
kg/h at a temperature of10°C. In the
vacuum chamber, 97% of the water and 99% of the organic impurities in the feed sublime (vaporize).
The dried product is then packaged and shipped. A vapor stream emerges from the chamber at 15°C.
During the process, 7.95×10
5
kJ/h of heat is transferred to the system.
(a)Draw and completely label aflowchart of the process and perform a degree-of-freedom analysis.
(b)Calculate the compositions andflow rates of the product and waste streams.

of sublimation and neglecting the contribution of the organic impurities to the energy balance.

(d)Evaporation  is  a  more  conventional  way  to  dry  a  wet  solid—that  is,  heating  the  solid  at
atmospheric  pressure  to  a  temperature  close  to  the  boiling  point  of  the  liquid  (in  this  case,
water) and holding it there long enough to drive off essentially all of the liquid. Give at least two
reasons why freeze drying is a better alternative for drying the oatmeal.
8.75. Freeze concentrationis used to produce a fruit-juice concentrate. A stream of fresh juice containing
12 wt% soluble solids in water at 20°C is combined with a recycle stream to form a preconcentrate,
which is fed to a crystallizer. The mixture is cooled in the crystallizer to7°C, thereby crystallizing
20,000 kg/h of ice. A slurry leaves the crystallizer containing 10 wt% ice and is fed to afilter. The
filtrate, which contains 45 wt% dissolved solids, is removed as the process product. The remaining
slurry, which contains all the ice and some concentrate (also containing 45% dissolved solids), is sent
to  a  separator  that  cleanly  removes  all  of  the  ice.  The  residual  liquid  is  the  recycle  stream  that
combines with the fresh feed to form the preconcentrate.
(a)Determine the rates (kg/h) at which fresh fruit juice is fed and concentrate is produced, and the
massflow rate (kg/h) and solids concentration of the preconcentrate.
(b)Calculate  the cooling  requirement (kW)  for  the freezer,  assuming that  the temperature  of the
recycle stream is 0°C and the heat capacity of all solutions is 4.0 kJ/(kg°C).
(c)An  alternative  to  freeze  concentration  is  to  evaporate  some  of  the  water  from  the  juice  at
atmospheric pressure, producing a concentrate with 45% dissolved solids. There are two reasons
this  process  may  be  less  attractive:  one  is  applicable  to  any  solute,  and  the  second  applies
particularly to a food product. Speculate on what they are.
(d)A  second  alternative  would  also  involve  vaporization,  but  at  low  pressure.  Why  might  this
alternative be preferable to the one in Part (c), and what would determine whether it would be
preferable to freeze concentration?
8.76.A mixture containing 35.0 mole%n-butane and the balance isobutane at 10°C enters a heat exchanger
at a rate of 24.5 kmol/h and a pressure high enough for the mixture to be a liquid. The exchanger has

(d)When the heat exchanger is run with_m

equal to the value calculated in Part (b), the exit temperature
of the hydrocarbon mixture is measured and found to be only 155°C instead of the design value of
180°C. The process operator observes that the outside of the exchanger is hot to the touch, indicating
that some of the heat lost by the heatingfluid is escaping into the plant instead of being transferred to
the hydrocarbon mixture. After discussing the situation with a production engineer, the operator
gradually  increases  theflow  rate  of  the  heatingfluid  while  continuing  to  monitor  the  outlet
temperature of the hydrocarbon. When theflow rate reaches 2540 kg/h, the outletfluid temperatures
level out at their design values (180°C for the hydrocarbon and 45°C for the heatingfluid). At what
rate (kJ/h) is heat being transferred from the exchanger to the plant air?
(e)When  the  heatingfluid  leaves  the  exchanger,  it  passes  through  a  heater,  which  raises  its
temperature back to 215°C, and is recycled back to the exchanger. How is the profitability of
the process being decreased by the heat loss from the exchanger to the surroundings? (Try to think
of two costs that result from the heat loss.)
(f)The engineer proposes adding more insulation to the heat exchanger, which would cut down on the
heat loss and reduce the required heatingfluidflow rate. What are advantages and disadvantages of
the two responses to the heat loss problem (adding insulation versus increasing the heatingfluidflow
rate)? Which would you guess would be the preferable response in the long run, and why?

Ketchup contains tomatoes, corn syrup, vinegar, sugar, water, and a variety of seasonings. A recipe for
homemade ketchup involves combining the ingredients and pouring them into sterile canning jars,
leaving some head space (air) at the top; covering each jar with a metal lid that has a rubber seal on its
bottom side; and loosely screwing a metal band onto the threaded top of the jar to keep the lid in place
while allowing steam and air to escape. The jars are immersed in boiling water for about 30 minutes and
then removed; the bands are tightened to assure a tight seal between the lid and the jar contents; and the
jars cool to room temperature. As long as the seal remains tight, a jar can be stored for up to a year.
Suppose the canning jar diameter is 2¼ inches, and a half-inch of headspace is left after the ketchup
has been added to the jar. Room temperature is 25°C. In the calculations that follow, assume that water is the
only volatile component of ketchup and that the head space volume remains constant at its initial value.
(a)During this process, what is the lowest pressure (atm) in the head space of the jar?
(b)Estimate  the  molar  composition  of  the  gas  in  the  head  space  when  the  canning  process  is
complete, stating all assumptions you make.
(c)Calculate the energy (kJ) transferred from the head space during the cooling process. Again, state
your assumptions.
(d)Speculate on the likely reason for boiling the ketchup.
(e)When the band is removed from the top of a jar of ketchup, the lid remainsfirmly attached to the
top of the jar and sometimes may need to be pried off. Why?

8.80.A  saturated  vapor  stream  containing  10.9 mole%  propane,  75.2%  isobutane,  and  13.9%n-butane

condensate is returned to the column as reflux, and the remainder is removed as the overhead column
product at a rate of 2500 kmol/h.
A decision must be made on whether to use a refrigerant or cooling water in the condenser. If
the refrigerant is used, it will be fed to the condenser as a liquid and vaporized by the heat released
by the condensing column vapor. The refrigerant pressure will be such that the vaporization takes

be taken from a nearby river at its average summer temperature of 25°C. To avoid environmental
problems, the temperature of the water returned to the river can be no greater than 34°C. With
either system, the temperature of the condensate should be 6°C greater than the outlet temperature
of the coolant, so that if the refrigerant is used the saturated condensate should have a temperature
of 0°C, and if cooling water is used the saturated condensate should be at 40°C. The condenser
pressure will be set to the minimum value needed to condense all of the vapor, which is to say the
condensate will be at its bubble-point temperature at the condenserpressure. Raoult’slawmaybe

A stream of methanol is joined by a recycle stream, also methanol, and the combined stream is fed to
the conversion reactor. Also entering the reactor are air (to oxidize some of the hydrogen produced in
the methanol conversion reaction) and steam (to control the reactor temperature). The product gas
from  the  reactor  contains  19.9 mole%  formaldehyde,  8.34%  methanol,  30.3%  nitrogen,  0.830%
oxygen, 5.0% hydrogen, and 35.6% water vapor and is at 600°C and 1 atm.
The following process is used to separate the formaldehyde from the unreacted methanol and
noncondensable gases. The gases leaving the reactor are fed to a waste-heat boiler, in which they are
cooled to 145°C, in the process generating steam at 3.1 bar from saturated liquid water (i.e., liquid water
at its boiling point) at the same pressure. The gases are cooled further to 100°C in a heat exchanger, where
they come into thermal contact with cooling water fed at 30°C. To reduce scaling on the heat exchanger
tubes, the temperature increase of the cooling water is limited to 15°C. The cooled gases are fed to an
absorption column, where methanol and formaldehyde are absorbed in water. Pure water at 20°Cisfedto
the top of the column. The gas leaving the absorber is saturated with water vapor at 27°C and 1 atm and
contains 200 parts of formaldehyde per million parts (by volume) of total gas. The aqueous solution
leaving the bottom of the absorber at 88°C is fed to a distillation column that operates at 1 atm. Thefinal
product solution, which contains 37 wt% formaldehyde, 1% methanol, and the balance water, is removed
from the reboiler at the bottom of the column, while pure methanol vapor emerges as the overhead
product and is condensed at 1 atm. A portion of the condensate is refluxed to the top of the column, and
the rest is recycled to the methanol conversion reactor. The reflux ratio, or ratio of methanol refluxed to
methanol recycled to the reactor, is 2.5:1.
(a)Taking  as  a  basis  of  calculation  100 mol  of  gas  leaving  the  conversion  reactor,  draw  and
completely label aflowchart of this process. Then calculate the moles of fresh methanol feed,
formaldehyde  product  solution,  recycled  methanol,  and  absorber  off-gas,  the  kg  of  steam
generated  in  the  waste-heat  boiler,  and  the  kg  of  cooling  water  fed  to  the  heat  exchanger
between  the  waste-heat  boiler  and  the  absorber.  Finally,  calculate  the  heat  (kJ)  that  must  be
removed  in  the  distillation  column  overhead  condenser,  assuming  that  methanol  enters  as  a
saturated vapor at 1 atm and leaves as a saturated liquid at the same pressure.

(b)A thermometer is mounted on the back porch of your house. What temperature would it read?

room temperature.

volume, dew-point temperature, and specific enthalpy of the room air. Take the molecular weight of dry
air to be 29.0, and for simplicity, assume the mass of dry air in the room stays constant at its initial value.

8.84.Asling psychrometeris a device to measure the humidity of air. A porous cloth (thewick) is wrapped

evaporates,  the  temperature  of  the  thermometer  bulb  drops,  andfinally  stabilizes  at  the  wet-bulb
temperature of the air. The dry-bulb temperature is read from a second thermometer mounted on the sling.
One summer day, the weather bureau reports a temperature of 33°C and a relative humidity of
40%. You wipe the sweat from your forehead and remark to a friend that you’d bet $5 that the report is
wrong, and the relative humidity is higher than 80%. He immediately puts a $5 bill on the table,

8.85.Humid air is enclosed in a 2.00-literflask at 40°C. Theflask is slowly cooled. When the temperature
reaches 20°C, drops of moisture become visible on theflask wall. Although the pressure in theflask

(increase, decrease, no change, can’t tell without more information)? Explain your answers.

Workers  in  the  petrochemical  industry  often  wearflame-retardant  jumpsuits.  Unfortunately,  the
material from which they are made hinders evaporation of perspiration, and consequently heat stress
can be a hazard in plants where it is hot and humid.
A  control  room  in  a  petrochemical  facility  with  dimensions  20 ft×40 ft×10 ft  is  used  by
workers to relax periodically in a cool environment. One summer day, the ambient air temperature is
33°C and the relative humidity is 96%. The air conditioning (AC) unit in the control room takes in
ambient air and cools it to 11°C, which causes condensation of water that is discharged to a drain, and
delivers the cooled air to the control room. The room air is maintained at 22°C, and there are 15
changes of room air per hour. The process may be shown schematically as follows.

To monitor the performance of the dryer by sampling the exiting chips and determining their
moisture content directly would be a cumbersome procedure and almost impossible to automate.
Instead, wet- and dry-bulb thermometers are mounted in both the inlet and outlet air lines, and the
moisture content of the exiting chips is determined by a material balance.

Path
A
:The entering liquid temperature (T

) is above the dew point of the entering air. Liquid
water evaporates into the superheated air, causing the absolute humidity of the air to increase (the
path rises) and both the evaporation and the contact with the cold liquid cause the air temperature
to decrease (the path moves to the left).
Path
B
:The entering liquid temperature is below the dew point of the entering air. The temperature
of the air contacted by the cold spray drops below the dew point (the path again moves to the
left), and water vapor condenses out of the air (the path moves down).
We thus arrive at the interesting conclusion thatyou can remove water from air by spraying water into
the air, provided that the entering liquid temperature is below the dew point of the entering air.
Use the psychrometric chart to solve the following spray-cooling problems.
(a)A spray tower is used to cool and humidify air with dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures of 40°C
and 18°C, respectively. The air emerges from the tower at 20°C. The tower operation is such that

psychrometric chart). How much water must be added as makeup per kg of dry air treated?
(b)A stream of air at 37°C and 50% relative humidityflowing at a rate of 1250 kg/h is to be cooled to
15°C and dehumidified in a spray tower. The air is saturated as it emerges from the tower. Liquid
water leaves the tower at 12°C; some is withdrawn, and the rest is cooled and recirculated. No heat
is transferred between the tower and its surroundings. Calculate the rate (kg/h) at which water
must be withdrawn from the recirculation loop and the heat duty on the cooler (kW). (Suggestion:
Use an overall energy balance for the latter calculation.)

which heat must be transferred to the vaporizer. (See Example 8.5-4.)

Each  time  this  reaction  takes  place,  three  chemical  bonds  are  broken  (two  between  hydrogen
atoms and one between oxygen atoms) and four bonds are formed among the atoms of the two
water molecules. As it happens, more energy is released when the water molecule bonds form than
it takes to break the hydrogen and oxygen molecule bonds. For the reactor temperature to remain
constant, the net energy released (about 250 kJ per mol of water formed) must be transferred from
the system; otherwise, the release of energy can raise the temperature substantially.
Inanyreaction between stable molecules, energy is required to break the reactant chemical
bonds, and energy is released when the product bonds form. If thefirst process absorbs less energy
than the second process releases (as in the water formation reaction), the reaction isexothermic:
the product molecules at a given temperature and pressure have lower internal energies (and hence
lower enthalpies) than the reactant molecules at the same temperature and pressure. The net energy
released—theheat of reaction—must be transferred from the reactor as heat or work, or else the
system temperature increases. On the other hand, if less energy is released when the product bonds
form than it took to break the reactant bonds, the reaction isendothermic: energy must be added to
the reactor as heat or work to keep the temperature from decreasing.
The large internal energy and enthalpy changes commonly associated with chemical reactions
can  play  major  roles  in  the  design  and  operation  of  chemical  processes.  If  a  reaction  is
endothermic,  the  energy  needed  to keep  the  reactor temperature  (and  hence  the  reaction  rate)
from dropping too much may cost enough to turn a profitable process into an unprofitable one. On
the other hand, if the reaction is exothermic, heat usually must be transferred from the reactor to
keep the temperature below a value that leads to safety or product quality problems. The heat
transferred may be an asset, as when the reactor is a combustion furnace and the heat is used to
generate steam in a boiler. It may also be a liability: for example, a momentary failure of a reactor
temperature-control system can lead to rapid overheating and possibly an explosion.
An energy balance on a reactor tells the process engineer how much heating or cooling the
reactor requires in order to operate at the desired conditions. In this chapter we show how enthalpy
changes that accompany chemical reactions are determined from tabulated physical properties of
the reactants and products and how calculated enthalpies of reaction are incorporated in energy
balances on reactive processes.

(Answers, p. 659)
1.Explain in your own words the concepts of exothermic and endothermic reactions. The terms
“chemical bonds”and“heat of reaction”should appear in your explanation.

2.The following two sentences seem to contain a self-contradiction.
In an exothermic reaction, the products are at a lower energy level than the reactants.
However, if the reactor is not cooled, the products are hotter than the reactants, which
means they must be at a higher energy level than the reactants.
Identify the logical error in this paragraph.
CREATIVITY EXERCISE
Suppose an exothermic reaction takes place in a continuous reactor. Think of several ways the heat
of reaction might be removed, illustrating your suggestions with sketches. (For example, pass a
coldfluid through a hollow metal tube immersed in the reactor, so that heat is transferred from the
hot reactingfluid to the coolant.)
9.0LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
Explain  in  your  own  words  the  concepts  of  heat  of  reaction;  exothermic  and  endothermic
reactions; heat  of formation;  combustion;  heat of combustion;  standard heats  of formation,
combustion,  and  reaction;  heating  value  of  a  fuel;  adiabaticflame  temperature;  ignition
temperature;  ignition  lag;  lower  and  upperflammability  limits  andflash  point  of  a  fuel;  a
flame; blue and yellowflames;flashback; and detonation.
Given (a) the amount of any reactant consumed or any product generated in a reaction at a given
temperature  and pressure and  (b)  the  heat  of the  reaction  at that  temperature  and  pressure,
calculate the total enthalpy change.
Determine  a  heat  of  reaction  from  heats  of  other  reactions  using  Hess’s  law.  Determine
standard enthalpies and internal energies of reaction from known standard heats of formation
and heats of combustion.
Write and solve an energy balance on a chemical reactor using either the heat of reaction
method (taking reactant and product species asreferences for enthalpy calculations) or the
heat  of  formation  method  (taking  elemental  species  as  references),  and  specify  which
method is preferable for a given process. Write the process path implicitly adopted when
each method is used.
Solve reactive-system energy-balance problems for (a) the heat transfer required for specified
inlet and outlet conditions, (b) the outlet temperature corresponding to a specified heat input
(e.g., for an adiabatic reactor), and (c) the product composition corresponding to a specified
heat input and a specified outlet temperature.
Solve energy-balance problems for processes involving solutions for which heats of solution
are significant.
Convert a higher heating value of a fuel to a lower heating value and vice versa.
9.1HEATS OF REACTION
When  a  chemical  reaction  occurs,  energy  is  consumed  as  chemical  bonds  between  atoms  in
reactant molecules are broken, and energy is released as the atoms form new bonds in product
molecules.  The  result  is  a  change  in  the  internal  energy—and  therefore  the  enthalpy—of  the
494CHAPTER 9Balances on Reactive Processes

system.  Theheat of reaction,ΔH
r
T;P,  is  the  enthalpy  difference  when  stoichiometric
quantities of reactants at a specified temperature and pressure react completely and the products
are at the same temperature and pressure.
For example, consider the reaction between solid calcium carbide and liquid water to form
solid calcium hydroxide and gaseous acetylene:

(9.1-2)
In this text, when a heat of reaction is given in kJ, the stoichiometric quantities referred to are
in gram-moles (mol). (See Footnote 1.) Equation 9.1-2 indicates that  when 1 mol  of solid
calcium carbonate and 2 mol of liquid water react completely to form 1 mol of solid calcium
hydroxide and 1 mol of gaseous acetylene, and the reactants and products are allat 25°Cand
1 atm, the enthalpy change is125:4 kJ. We may write this result in any of the following
ways:

Note:In many textbooks you will see heats of reaction given with the dimension energy/mole (most commonly, kJ/mol).
The value ofΔH

with such units has exactly the same meaning as in the definition we have given—the enthalpy change
when stoichiometric amounts of reactants react completely. The mol in the denominator simply indicates the molar unit to
be used (mol, kmol, lb-mole, etc.) when specifying those stoichiometric amounts, as opposed to meaning per mol of a
particular species. In this text, whenever heats of reaction are given in kJ, the molar unit will always be mol, and if they are
in Btu, the unit will be lb-mole.

If you are confused by this derivation, no one could blame you, but the calculations you will need to
do are straightforward. If you are analyzing a process with species amounts expressed in moles, use
Eq. (9.1-4a), and if the amounts are expressed as molarflow rates, use Eq. (9.1-4b).
Following are several important terms and observations related to heats of reaction.

ΔH
r
T;Pis positive the reaction isendothermicatTandP. These definitions of exothermic
and endothermic are equivalent to the ones given earlier in terms of chemical bond strengths.
(Convince yourself.)
2.At low and moderate pressures,ΔH

T;Pis nearly independent of pressure.Wewill

asΔH

496CHAPTER 9Balances on Reactive Processes

3.The value of the heat of a reaction depends on how the stoichiometric equation is written. For
example,
CH

g!CO

g2H

2
Ol:ΔH
r2
25°C1780:6kJ
This result should seem reasonable to you if you look back at the definition ofΔH
r
. Thefirst
line states that the combined enthalpy of 1 gram-mole of CO
2
plus 2 gram-moles of liquid water
is 890.3 kJ lower than the combined enthalpy of 1 gram-mole of methane plus 2 gram-moles of
oxygen  at  25°C.  Doubling  the  quantity  of  reactants  at  a  given  condition  doubles  the  total
enthalpy  of  the  reactants  at  that  condition,  and  similarly  for  the  products.  The  difference
between the product and reactant enthalpies in the second reaction (by definition,ΔH
r2
) must
therefore be double the enthalpy difference in thefirst reaction (ΔH
r1
).
4.The value of a heat of reaction depends on the phases (gas,liquid,or solid) of the reactants and
products. For example,
CH

The only difference between the reactions is that the water formed is a liquid in thefirst one and
a vapor in the second. Since enthalpy is a state function, the difference between the two heats of
reaction must be the enthalpy change associated with the vaporization of 2 mol of water at
25°C—that is, 2Δ

(25°C).
5.Thestandard heat of reaction,ΔH

products are at a specified reference temperature and pressure, usually (and always in this text)

A  heat  of  reaction  may  be  measured  in  acalorimeter—a  closed  reactor  immersed  in  afluid
contained in a well-insulated vessel. The rise or fall of thefluid temperature can be measured and
used to determine the energy released or absorbed by the reaction, and the value ofΔH

may then
be calculated from that energy and known reactant and product heat capacities.

9.3FORMATION REACTIONS AND HEATS OF FORMATION
Aformation reactionof a compound is the reaction in which the compound is formed from its
elemental constituents as they normally occur in nature (e.g., O
2
rather than O). The enthalpy
change associated with the formation of 1 mole of the compound at a reference temperature and
pressure (usually 25°C and 1 atm) is thestandard heat of formationof the compound,Δ
^
H

f
.
Standard heats of formation for many compounds are listed in Table B.1 of this text and on
pp. 2-185 through 200 ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook.

The values in Table B.1 can
also be retrieved using the APEx functions DeltaHfg(“compound”), DeltaHfl(“compound”), and
DeltaHfc(“compound”)  for  the  specified  compound  in  gaseous,  liquid,  and  solid  (crystalline)
forms, respectively. For example,Δ

H

for crystalline ammonium nitrate is given in Table B.1 as
365.15 kJ/mol,  where  the  mol  is  understood  to  be  of  NH
4
NO

.  This  means  the  change  in
enthalpy  associated  with  forming  one  gram-mole  of  crystalline  ammonium  nitrate  from  its
elements is365.15 kJ. We could also write this in terms of a heat of reaction:

9.4HEATS OF COMBUSTION
Thestandard heat of combustionof a substance,Δ
^
H

c
, is the heat of the combustion of that
substance with oxygen to yield specified products [e.g., CO
2
(g) and H
2
O(l)], with both reactants
and products at 25°C and 1 atm (the arbitrary but conventional reference state).
Table B.1 lists standard heats of combustion for a number of substances. The given values are
based on the following assumptions: (a) all carbon in the fuel forms CO
2
(g), (b) all hydrogen
forms H
2
O(l), (c) all sulfur forms SO
2
(g), and (d) all nitrogen forms N
2
(g). The standard heat of
combustion of liquid ethanol, for example, is given in Table B.1 asΔ
^
H

c
1366:9 kJ/mol, where
the  mol  is  understood  to  be  of  ethanol.  This  means  the  change  in  enthalpy  associated  with
complete  combustion  of  one  gram-mole  of  liquid  ethanol  with  the  stoichiometric  amount  of
oxygen is1366.9 kJ. We could also write this in terms of a heat of reaction:

The  heats  of  combustion  in  Table  B.1  can  also  be  retrieved  using  the  APEx  functions
DeltaHcg(“compound”),  DeltaHcl(“compound”), and DeltaHcc(“compound”) for the specified
compound  in  gaseous,  liquid,  and  solid  (crystalline)  forms,  respectively.  Additional  heats  of
combustion  are  given on  pp. 2-195  through  2-200  ofPerry’s Chemical Engineers’Handbook
(see Footnote 2).
Standard heats of reactions that involve only combustible substances and combustion
products can be calculated from tabulated standard heats of combustion, in another application
of  Hess’s  law.  A  hypothetical  reaction  path  may  be  constructed  in  which  (a)  all  combustible
reactants are burned with O
2
at 25°C and (b) CO
2
and H
2
O combine to form the reaction products
plus O
2
. Step (b) involves the reverse of the combustion reactions of the reaction products. Since
both  steps  involve  only  combustion  reactions,  the  total  enthalpy  change—which  equals  the
desired heat of reaction—can be determined entirely from heats of combustion as

CREATIVITY EXERCISE
When an exothermic reaction takes place, the energy released raises the temperature of the reactor
contents unless the reactor is cooled. Suppose such a reaction occurs in a batch reactor.
1.Think  of  as  many  reasons  as  you  can  why  you  might  not  want  the  reactor  temperature  to
increase. (Example:The product might degrade or decompose at higher temperatures.)
2.Think of as many  ways as you can to keep the  reactor  temperature  from  increasing  as the
reaction proceeds. (Example:Throw in some ice.)
9.5ENERGY BALANCES ON REACTIVE PROCESSES
9.5a  General Procedures
To  perform  energy  balance  calculations  on  a  reactive  system,  proceed  much  as  you  did  for
nonreactive  systems:  (a)  draw  and  label  aflowchart;  (b)  use  material  balances  and  phase
equilibrium relationships such as Raoult’s law to determine as many stream component amounts
orflow rates as possible; (c) choose reference states for specific enthalpy (or internal energy)
calculations  and  prepare  andfill  in  an  inlet–outlet  enthalpy  (or  internal  energy)  table;  and
(d) calculateΔ
_
H(orΔUorΔH), substitute the calculated value in the appropriate form of the
energy balance, and complete the required calculation.
Two methods are commonly used to choose reference states for enthalpy calculations and to
calculate specific enthalpies andΔ
_
H.
4
We outline the two approaches below, using a propane
combustion process to illustrate them. For simplicity, the material balance calculations for the
illustrative process have been performed and the results incorporated into theflowchart.

Thus, 19,700 kW of heat must be transferred from the reactor to maintain the product temperature at 300°C. If
less heat were transferred, more of the heat of reaction would go into the reaction mixture and the outlet
temperature would increase.
The heat of formation method, which involves taking elemental constituents of the reactants
and products in their naturally occurring states as references for enthalpy calculations, is usually
convenient for processes that involve several simultaneous reactions. The next example illustrates
this approach.

9.5b Processes with Known Heat Inputs: Adiabatic Reactors
In the reactive systems we have looked at so far, the inlet and outlet conditions were specified and
the required heat input could be determined from an energy balance.
In  another  important  class  of  problems,  the  input  conditions,  heat  input,  and  product
composition are specified, and the outlet temperature is to be calculated. To solve such problems,
you must evaluate the enthalpies of the products relative to the chosen reference states in terms of
the  unknownfinal  temperature,  and  then  substitute  the  resulting  expressions  into  the  energy

(which equalsΔH) equal to 0 by varying the value in Cell B6 (the temperature). When you click“Solve”

185°C  and the value in Cell B10

, more than close enough to zero for our purposes.
Contrast  the  ease  of  this  calculation  with  the  cumbersome  set  of  calculations  in  Part  (a).  This
example would be even easier if the heat capacity formula for acetaldehyde were listed in Table B.2 so
that the Enthalpy function of APEx could be used to determine

:Since it isn’t, the formula for the
integral of the given formula must be entered manually in [B8].
Another class of problems involves processes for which the heat input and outlet temperature
are specified but the extent of reaction and product composition are not. Solving such problems
requires the simultaneous solution of material and energy balance equations, as the next example
illustrates.
Example 9.5-4Simultaneous Material and Energy Balances
The ethanol dehydrogenation reaction of Example 9.5-3 is carried out with the feed entering at 300°C. The
feed contains 90.0 mole% ethanol and the balance acetaldehyde and enters the reactor at a rate of 150 mol/s.
To keep the temperature from dropping too much and thereby decreasing the reaction rate to an unacceptably
low level, heat is transferred to the reactor. When the heat addition rate is 2440 kW, the outlet temperature is
253°C. Calculate the fractional conversion of ethanol achieved in the reactor.

and one of the reactant or product species is a solution, its specific enthalpy usually has the

while the heat of formation of a solution is alwaysobtained in the desired units, solution heat

This is a straightforward problem, but the number of intermediate calculations required to solve it might
make it appear more difficult than it is. Let us summarize what must be done:
1.Solve form
1
,m
2
, andm
3
by material balances.
2.Calculate the solvent-to-solute mole ratios of all solutions. (The quantities are needed to determine
the solution enthalpies from tabulated heats of solution.)
3.Calculate the enthalpies of the solutions. (This will require additional composition calculations to
allow the use of tabulated solution heat capacities.)
4.Write the energy balance equation and solve it for the heat removal rate.
Observe that nothing here is really new, and, as we work our way through to thefinal result, recognize
that most of the calculations are simply conversionsof solution compositions from mass fractions to mole
ratios  back  to  mass  ratios—conversions  required  by  the  nature  of  the  available  data  for  properties  of
solutions.

9.6  Fuels and Combustion519

The analysis of fuels and combustion reactions and reactors has always been an important
activity for chemical engineers. In this section, we review the properties of the fuels most often
used for power generation and outline techniques for energy balances on combustion reactors.
9.6a  Fuels and Their Properties
Fuels burned in power-plant furnaces may be solids, liquids, or gases. Some of the more common
fuels are:
Solid fuels:Principally coal (a mixture of carbon, water, noncombustible ash, hydrocarbons, and
sulfur), coke (primarily carbon—the solid residue left after coal or petroleum is heated, driving
off volatile substances and decomposing hydrocarbons), and to a small extent wood and solid
waste (garbage).
Liquid fuels:Principally hydrocarbons obtained by distilling crude oil (petroleum); also coal tars
and  shale  oil.  There  is  also  a  strong  worldwide  interest  in  the  use  of  alcohols  obtained  by
fermenting grains and other forms of biomass.
Gaseous fuels:Principally natural gas (80% to 95% methane, the balance ethane, propane, and
small  quantities  of  other  gases);  also  light  hydrocarbons  obtained  from  petroleum  or  coal
treatment, acetylene, and hydrogen.
Coal contains primarily carbon and combustible hydrocarbons, but also has substantial amounts of
noncombustible ash and as much as 5% sulfur by weight. These minor constituents often raise
issues in the use of coal and stimulate the following questions.
1.What  becomes  of  the  sulfur  when  coal  is  burned?  What  about  the  ash?  (Suggest  two
possibilities for the ash.)
2.In view of the answer to the preceding question, why might coal be less desirable as a fuel than
natural gas?
3.What might prompt a power company to use coal as its primary fuel despite its drawbacks
relative to liquid or gaseous fuels?

3.In 2008, the average cost of coal for utility plants was roughly $41 per ton. What would
natural  gas  have  to  cost  ($/ton)  to  be  as  economical  as  coal  on  a  $/Btu  basis?  (Use

fixed amount of heat.
9.6b  Adiabatic Flame Temperature
When  a  fuel  is  burned,  a  considerable  amount  of  energy  is  released.  Some  of  this  energy  is
transferred out of the reactor as heat, and the remainder raises the temperature of the reaction
products; the less heat transferred, the higher the product temperature. The highest achievable
temperature is reached if the reactor is adiabatic and all of the energy released by combustion goes
to  raise  the  temperature  of the  combustion  products.  This  temperature  is called  theadiabatic
flame temperature,T
ad
.
Calculation  of  an  adiabaticflame  temperature  follows  the  general  procedure  outlined  in
Section 9.5b. Unknown streamflow rates arefirst determined by material balances. Reference
conditions  are  chosen,  specific  enthalpies  of  feed  components  are  calculated,  and  specific
enthalpies of product components are expressed in terms of the product temperature,T

In Cell F10, 44.013 is the heat of vaporization of water at 25°C and 1 atm (from Equation 9.6-2a). Once the
spreadsheet has been set up as shown, Excel’s Solver is used to set the value in Cell B16 equal to zero by
varying the value in Cell B15. The value in Cell B15 immediately changes to the adiabatic temperature,
T
ad
1257°C
The furnace walls will therefore never be exposed to a temperature greater than 1257°C as long as the feed and
air properties remain the same.
Once the spreadsheet has been set up, the adiabatic temperature can be easily calculated for different fuel and
air temperatures by varying the values in Cells B13 and B14 and repeating the calculations using Excel’s Solver.
The adiabaticflame temperature is much greater when pure oxygen rather than air is fed to the
reactor and is greatest when the fuel and oxygen are fed in stoichiometric proportion.

9.6c  Flammability and Ignition
In this section and the one that follows, we discuss qualitatively what happens during the rapid chemical
reaction between a fuel and oxygen. Along the way, we provide answers to the following questions:
1.What is aflame? Why are someflames blue and some yellow?
2.If you light a match in a mixture of methane and air that contains 10% CH
4
by volume, the
mixture will burn explosively, but if the mixture contains 20% CH
4
nothing will happen. Why?
3.What is an explosion? What is the loud noise you hear when something explodes?
4.Hydrogen and oxygen react explosively to form water, yet if you mix these two gases in aflask,
nothing happens. Why not?
We  have  so far  in this  text  only  considered  the  initial  andfinal  conditions in  a chemical
reactor, and not how long it may have taken to get from one to the other. When you studychemical
reaction kinetics,  you  will  learn  that  the  rate  of  a  reaction  depends  strongly  on  the  reaction
temperature; for many reactions, a temperature rise of only 10°C is enough to double the rate.
Suppose a mixture of methane and air containing 10 mole% CH
4
is heated by a central heat
source (e.g., an electrical coil) at atmospheric pressure, beginning at room temperature. Although
methane reacts with oxygen
CH
4
2O
2
!CO
2
2H
2
O
the reaction proceeds at an immeasurably low rate at room temperature, and to an observer nothing
would seem to be happening in the reactor.
As the temperature increases, the rate of the oxidation reaction also increases, and measurable
amounts of CO
2
and H
2
O appear. However, if the heat source is turned off, the reactor temperature
drops again—the rate at which heat is generated by the reaction alone is not enough to compensate
for the rate at which heat is lost from the reaction zone.
However, if the temperature at any point in the reactor reaches about 640°C or higher, the rate of
heat generation by the reaction exceeds the rate of heat loss from the reaction zone. The gas adjacent
to this zone is then heated above 640°C, causing the zone of rapid reaction to spread. The temperature
of the gas rapidly rises by several hundred or even a thousand degrees in a fraction of a second; even if
the heating source is turned off, the rate of heat generation by the now rapidly occurring reaction is
enough to maintain the system at its high temperature until the reactants are exhausted.
Combustionis defined as a rapid, high-temperature oxidation reaction. What happens in the
reactor just described after the reaction rate accelerates dramatically is combustion, whereas the
initial slow oxidation reaction between methane and oxygen to form CO

reactions between these species, such as the formation reaction of formaldehyde

The rapid increase in the rate of an oxidation reaction when the reaction mixture exceeds a
certain temperature is calledignition; the temperature at which this phenomenon occurs is called
theignition temperature, and the time between the instant when the mixture reaches the ignition
temperature and the moment of ignition is theignition lag. The ignition temperature and lag are
shown here on a representative plot of the temperature of a fuel mixture that is being heated.

9.6  Fuels and Combustion525

The  value  of  the  ignition  temperature  depends  on  a  number  of  things  for  a  given  fuel,
including the fuel-to-air ratio, the total pressure in the reactor, and even the reactor geometry. For
any  given  fuel,  there  is  a  lower  limit  to  this  quantity  called  theautoignition temperature.
Representative values of this quantity for stoichiometric fuel–air mixtures at 1 atm are given in
Table  9.6-2.  Ignition  lags  are  typically  0.1–10 s  in  duration  and  decrease  with  increasing
temperature above the autoignition temperature.
We saw in Section 9.6b that the highest attainable temperature in a combustion reaction—the
adiabaticflame temperature—depends on the fuel-to-air ratio, and we stated but did not prove that
this upper temperature limit is a maximum when the fuel and oxygen are present in stoichiometric
proportion. If the mixture is eitherrich(fuel in excess) orlean(O
2

temperature decreases.
The  termslower (or lean)flammability limitandupper (rich)flammability limitwere
introduced  in  previous  end-of-chapter  problems.  A  fuel–air  mixture  whose  composition  falls
outside these limits is incapable of igniting or exploding, even if exposed to a spark orflame. The
range of compositions between the twoflammability limits is known as theexplosive rangeof the
mixture,  and  the  termslower and upper explosion limitsare  used  interchangeably  with  the
correspondingflammability limits.
If a liquid (or a volatile solid) is exposed to air, the vapor given off could form a combustible
mixture with the air adjacent to it, and a spark or match lit in the vicinity of the liquid could cause

the mixture to ignite or explode. Theflash pointof a liquid is the temperature at which the liquid
gives off enough vapor to form an ignitable mixture with the air above the liquid surface. Theflash
point of gasoline, for example, is roughly43°C, and that of ethanol is 12.8°C, so that these
liquids constitutefire hazards at room temperature, while theflash points of fuel oils vary from
38°Cto55°C, making the hazards associated with these materials considerably less. Table 9.6-2
includesflash points for a limited number of species.
Table 9.6-2 showsflammability limits for a limited number of species drawn from a list given
by Crowl and Louvar. For example, Table 9.6-2 gives the lower and upperflammability limits of a
mixture of methane in air as 5.3% and 15.0%. Thus, a CH
4
–air mixture containing between 5.3%
and 15.0% CH
4
must be considered afire or explosion hazard, while a mixture containing 3% CH
4
or 18% CH
4
may be considered safe as long as the latter mixture is not diluted with additional air.
Crowl and Louvar andPerry’s Chemical Engineers Handbook(Footnote 2, pp. 2-515 to 2-517)
give methods for estimatingflammability limits when tabulated values cannot be found, and they
also give methods for accounting for the effects of temperature and pressure onflammability
limits.

Propane gas and air are to be mixed and fed to a combustion reactor. The combustion is to be initiated with a
gas torch. Determine the minimum and maximum percentages of propane in the feed to the reactor and the

(b)If  a  methane–air  mixture  containing  20%  CH

(c)Pure methane is clearly not within the explosive range of methane–air mixtures, yet if
pure methane is blown out of a cylinder into a room and a match is lit nearby, a flame
is observed that persists after the match is withdrawn. How is this possible?
9.6d  Flames and Detonations
Suppose a combustible gas–air mixture is contained in an open-ended tube, and a match or another
ignition  source  is  applied  to  one  end  of  the  tube.  The  gas  mixture  at  this  end  is  heated  and
eventually ignites.  The intense heat  generated by  the  combustion reaction  raises  the  chemical
species  formed  during  the  reaction  to  high  energy  states.  When  these  species  return  to  lower
energy states, some of the energy they lose is given off in the form of light. The result is a visible
flameaccompanying the combustion.
9.6  Fuels and Combustion527

Initially theflame is located at the end of the tube that was ignited. However, the heat of
combustion quickly raises the adjacent unburned gas to its ignition point, causing theflame to
“travel”toward the other end of the tube. At some point, the tube appears as follows.
End originally ignited
Combustion products, high 
T
Unburned fuel and air, low T
Reaction zone—flame
Ignition zone—flame front
Theflame front moves in the direction of the unburned gases at a velocity called theflame
velocity, which typically has a value of 0.3 to 1 m/s. The exact value of theflame velocity depends
on a number of things, including the type of fuel, fuel-to-air ratio, initial temperature and pressure
of the unburned gases, and the geometry of the combustion chamber.
Suppose  now  that  instead  of  being  stationary  in  the  tube,  the  combustion  mixture  is  fed
continuously into the bottom (as in a Bunsen burner), and the top is ignited. If the velocity with
which the gases leave the tube equals the velocity with which theflame would travel down in a
stationary gas, astationaryflameis achieved at the top. The wall of the tube lowers theflame
velocity, so that theflame burns at the end but does not penetrate into the tube.
Flame
Fuel
and air
If the gasflow rate is increased, theflame size and rate of heat generation both increase, since
a larger quantity of gas is being burned. However, once theflow rate reaches a critical value, the
flame can no longer travel back as fast as the combustion region is transported away from the
burner. The gases in the combustion region become increasingly diluted with air, until the region
finally falls outside theflammability limits and thefire is literally blown out.
On the other hand, if the gasflow rate to the burner tube is decreased, the gas velocity in the
tube may become lower than theflame propagation velocity in the tube. The result isflashback—
theflame travels back through the tube toward the fuel source. Flashback is extremely dangerous,
and anyflow system involving combustible gases must be designed to guarantee that theflow rate
stays above theflame propagation velocity.
When combustion of a well-mixed fuel–air mixture occurs, the fuel rapidly reacts with oxygen
to form a number of unstable intermediate species (such as oxygen and hydrogen atoms, and OH and
H
2
O radicals), which then proceed through a complicated chain mechanism to form CO
2
and H
2
O.
Some of these species undergo transitions that cause them to emit radiation whose wavelength falls
within the blue region of the visible spectrum. The result is that theflame appears blue.
528CHAPTER 9Balances on Reactive Processes

On the other hand, when the fuel and air are not well mixed (such as when a pure hydrocarbon
gas is burned as it emerges from a stack and mixes with atmospheric air), the combustion proceeds
relatively slowly, and some of the hydrocarbon fuel decomposes to form elementary carbon and
hydrogen before oxidation takes place. The heat of reaction is sufficient to raise the temperature to
a point where the carbon particles glow incandescently. A yellowflame is the result.
Finally, suppose ignition of a gas takes place in a confined or partially confined space. The
large temperature rise in the combustion region causes a rapid buildup of pressure in this region. If
the combustion is fast enough and the heat of reaction is high enough, adetonationmay result,
wherein a sharply defined high-pressure front, orshock wave, travels through the gas at a velocity
well in excess of theflame propagation velocity in the gas. The shock wave rapidly compresses
and ignites the gas as it passes through, giving the appearance of an instantaneous combustion.
Even  after  the  combustion reaction  that  gave rise  to the  detonation  has consumed all  the
available fuel, the shock wave can persist for large distances, carrying with it considerable energy.
The energy of even a small shock wave is sufficient to vibrate the eardrums of anyone near the site
of the detonation, producing the bang that always accompanies an explosion. The energy of a large
shock wave may be sufficient to demolish a city.

9.7  SUMMARY
Large internal energy and enthalpy changes are often associated
with chemical reactions, leading to substantial heat transfer (heat-
ing or cooling) requirements for chemical reactors. This chapter
outlines methods of calculatingΔ
_
Hfor open reactive systems and
ΔUandΔHfor closed systems. Once the appropriate quantity has
been determined, it may be substituted into the energy balance to
determine the required heat transfer.

, is the heat of reaction at a specified reference
temperature and pressure, in this text 25°C and 1 atm. At low to
moderate pressures, the heat of reaction is nearly independent ofP.

which signifies that if 1 g-mole of gaseous methane and 2 g-moles
of gaseous oxygen at 25°C and 1 atm react completely to form
1 g-mole of gaseous carbon dioxide and 2 g-moles of liquid
water and the products are brought back to 25°Cand1atm,
the  net  enthalpy  change  would  beΔH890:3 kJ.  If  the
energy balance reduces toQΔH, 890.3 kJ of heat would
have  to  be  transferred  away  from  the  reactor  to  keep  the
products at 25°C.
IfΔH
r
T;P<0, the reaction isexothermicatTandP:less
energy  is  required  to  break  the  bonds  holding  the  reactant
molecules  together  than  is  released  when  the  product  bonds
form, resulting in a net release of energy as the reaction proceeds.
This energy may be transferred from the reactor as heat or it may
serve to raise the temperature of the reaction mixture.
Similarly,  ifΔH
r
T;P>0,  the  reaction  isendothermic:
more  energy  is  required  to  break  the  reactant  bonds  than  is
released  when  the  product  bonds  form,  leading  to  a  net
absorption  of  energy  as  the  reaction  proceeds.  Unless  this
energy is supplied to the reactor as heat, the mixture tempera-
ture decreases.
Provided  that  gaseous  reactants  and  products  behave  ideally
and  the  specific  volumes  of  liquid  and  solid  reactants  and
9.7  Summary529

products are negligible compared with the specific volumes of
the gases, theinternal energy of reactionmay be calculated
from  Equation  9.1-5.  (This  quantity  is  required  for  energy
balances on constant-volume batch reactors.)
According  toHess’s law,  if  a  stoichiometric  equation  for  a
reaction can be obtained as a linear combination of the equa-
tions for other reactions (i.e., by adding and subtracting those
equations), the heat of thefirst reaction can be calculated as the
same linear combination of the heats of the other reactions.
Thestandard heat of formationof a species,Δ

, is the heat
of the reaction in which one mole of the species is formed from
its  constituent  elemental  species  in  their  naturally  occurring
states at 25°C and 1 atm. Standard heats of formation of many
species are listed in Table B.1.

heat of the reaction in which one mole of the species undergoes

When  performing  energy  balances  on  a  reactive  chemical
process,  two  procedures  may  be  followed  in  the  calculation
ofΔ
_
H(orΔHorΔU) that  differ in the choice  of reference
states for enthalpy or internal energy calculations. In theheat of
reaction method, the references are the reactant and product
species at 25°C and 1 atm in the phases (solid, liquid, or gas) for
which the heat of reaction is known. In theheat of formation
method, the references are the elemental species that constitute
the reactant and product species [e.g., C(s), O
2
(g), H
2
(g), etc.]
at  25°C  and  1 atm.  In  both  methods,  reference  states  for
nonreactive  species  may  be  chosen  for  convenience,  as  was
done for the nonreactive processes of Chapters 7 and 8.
The heat of reaction method may be slightly easier when only one
reaction occurs and the heat of reaction is known. When this
method is used, the specific enthalpy of each species in every
feed or product stream is calculated by choosing a process path
from the reference state to the process state, calculatingΔ
^
Hfor
each heating and cooling step and each phase change in the path,
and summing the enthalpies for the steps. When specific enthal-
pies have been calculated for all species in all of their inlet and

The heat of formation method is generally easier when there are
multiple  reactions.  When  this  method  is  used,  the  specific
enthalpy of a species in a feed or product stream is calculated
by  choosing  a  process  path  from  the  reference  state  (the
elements  at  25°C)  to  the  process  state,  beginning  with  the
formation  of  the  species  from  the  elementsΔ

Sometimes the feed conditions and heat input to a reactor are
specified (as in an adiabatic reactor) and the outlet temperature,
T

for the specific enthalpies of the reactor outlet species in terms

Thestandard heat of formation of a liquid solutionis the
sum of the standard heat of formation of the solute and the
standard  heat  of  solution  calculated  using  the  methods  of
Section 8.5. The standard heat of a reaction involving solu-
tions may be determined as the weighted sum of the heats of
formation of the reactants and products (including the solu-
tions),  with  the  weighting  factors  being  the  stoichiometric
coefficients  (positive  for  products,  negative  for  reactants).

If the system in question is a closed system at constant pressure or if it is continuous and an amount (and not aflow rate) is
the basis of calculation, the dots over variables would be deleted in the above formulas. If the system is a closed system at
constant volume,Uwould replaceH.
530CHAPTER 9Balances on Reactive Processes

An energy balance for a reactor in which solutions react or
form may be written by taking the feed and product solutions
at 25°C and 1 atm as references and using the heat of reaction
method.
Combustionis  a  rapid  high-temperature  reaction  between  a
fuel  and  oxygen.  Thehigher heating valueof  a  fuel  is  the
negative of the standard heat of combustion of the fuelΔ

with H
2
O(l) as a combustion product, and thelower heating
valueis the negative of the standard heat of combustion based
on  H
2
O(v)  as  a  product.  The  relationship  between  the  two
heating values is given by Equation 9.6-1.
Theadiabaticflame temperatureof a fuel is the tempera-
ture  that  would  be  attained  if  the  fuel  were  burned  in  an
adiabatic combustion chamber and all of the energy released
went into raising the temperature of the reaction products
(as opposed to being absorbed by or transferred through the
reactor wall).
When the temperature of a combustible mixture exceeds a certain
value,  after  a  short  time  lag  the  rate  of  the  reaction  and  the
reaction temperature increase extremely rapidly. This phenome-
non  is  calledignition,  and  the  time  interval  afterT
ignition
is
reached  and  before  the  temperature  increases  sharply  is  the
ignition lag.  The  lowest  temperature  at  which  ignition  may
occur for a fuel is theautoignition temperatureof the fuel.
If the mole percentage of a fuel in a fuel-air mixture falls below
a certain value (thelowerflammability limit) or above another
value  (theupperflammability limit),  the  mixture  will  not
ignite  or  explode,  even  if  exposed  to  aflame  or  spark.  The
composition range between theflammability limits is called the
explosive rangeof the mixture.

Fuel cellshave  been  proposed  as  an  alternative  energy  technology  for  use  in  stationary  and
transportation applications. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device in which hydrogen reacts with
oxygen from the air to produce water and DC electricity. The mostflexible fuel cell design is the proton
exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). A 1-W PEMFC could be used for portable applications such
as cellular telephones, and a 100-kW PEMFC could be used to power an automobile.
A schematic of a 10-cell stack of fuel cells connected in series is shown on the next page. Each cell
consists of an anode (left block with lines sloping up and to the right), electrolyte membrane (center
block with horizontal lines), and cathode (right block with line sloping down and to the right). The
hydrogen and air are fed in parallel to each cell. Also, the exiting gasflows are collected in parallel.

be used to produce electricity for an apartment complex. At full load, the fuel cell operates at a voltage
of 26 volts and a current of 500 amps and has a maximum power of 13 kW. (Note:A single cell operates
at 0.7 V.)

www.eia.doe.gov), a typical household
uses 936 kWh in a month. Determine the average power usage (kW) per household and use the
result to estimate the number of apartment units that could be powered with the 13 kW fuel cell.

follows from the reaction at the anode. If the hydrogen is fed in 15% excess of this amount and the
air is fed in 200% excess of the amount required to consume all the hydrogen, what are theflow
rates of hydrogen and air required in mol/s and SLPM (standard liters per minute)?

reserves—such as Brazil—have found it profitable to convert a portion of their agricultural output
to ethanol for fuel or for use as a feedstock in the synthesis of other chemicals.
In one such process, a portion of the starch in corn is converted to ethanol in two consecutive
reactions.  In  asaccharificationreaction,  starch  decomposes  in  the  presence  of  certain  enzymes
(biological catalysts) to form an aqueousmashcontaining maltose (C
12
H
22
O
11
, a sugar) and several
other decomposition products. The mash is cooled and combined with additional water and a yeast
culture in a batch fermentation tank (fermentor). In the fermentation reaction (actually a complex series
of reactions), the yeast culture grows and in the process converts maltose to ethanol and carbon dioxide:

The fermentor is a 550,000 gallon tankfilled to 90% of its capacity with a suspension of mash and
yeast in water. The mass of the yeast is negligible compared to the total mass of the tank contents. Thermal
energy is released by the exothermic conversion of maltose to ethanol. In an adiabatic operating stage, the
temperature of the tank contents increases from an initial value of 85°Fto95°F, and in a second stage the
temperature is kept at 95°F by a reactor cooling system. Thefinal reaction mixture contains carbon dioxide
dissolved in a slurry containing 7.1 wt% ethanol, 6.9 wt% soluble and suspended solids, and the balance
water. The mixture is pumped to aflash evaporator in which CO
2
is vaporized, and the ethanol product is
then separated from the remaining mixture components in a series of distillation and stripping operations.
Data
One bushel (56 lb
m
) of corn yields 25 gallons of mash fed to the fermentor, which in turn yields 2.6
gallons of ethanol. Roughly 101 bushels of corn is harvested from an acre of land.

In respiration, air is inhaled into the lungs, which provide a large surface area for transport of oxygen,
carbon dioxide, and water to or from the blood. The transported oxygen is delivered to body cells where it
oxidizes glucose and fats from food to produce carbon dioxide, water, and thermal energy. The carbon
dioxide and water are transported from the cells to the blood and back to the lungs, from which they are
exhaled. The exhaled gas is at body temperature and saturated with water, some produced in the glucose
and fat oxidation and some additionally drawn from moist lung tissue. Other water-containing streams—
food, water, perspiration, and excreted waste streams—maintain the body’s level of hydration.
Suppose an individual inhales air at 20°C and 20% relative humidity, and 25% of the inhaled oxygen
is consumed in the glucose oxidation reaction. (Under certain conditions, it is reasonable to neglect the
oxidation of fats.) Aflowchart of the respiration–metabolism process is shown below. The water in the
exhaled gas equals the inhaled water plus the water produced by glucose oxidation plus additional water
drawn from the lungs.Q

A liquid feed containing 75 mole% propylene and 25%n-butane and a second liquid stream
containing essentially pure benzene are fed to the reactor. Fresh benzene and recycled benzene, both at
77°F, are mixed in a 1:3 ratio (1 mole fresh feed/3 moles recycle) and passed through a heat exchanger,
where they are heated by the reactor effluent before being fed to the reactor. The reactor effluent enters
the exchanger at 400°F and leaves at 200°F. The pressure in the reactor is sufficient to maintain the
effluent stream as a liquid.
After being cooled in the heat exchanger, the reactor effluent is fed to a distillation column (T1).
All of the butane and unreacted propylene are removed as overhead product from the column, and the
cumene and unreacted benzene are removed as bottoms product and fed to a second distillation column
(T2) where they are separated. The benzene leaving the top of the second column is the recycle that is

To provide heat for this endothermic reaction, some oxygen is included in the feed to the reactor,
leading to the partial combustion of the hydrogen produced in the methanol decomposition.
The feed to an adiabatic formaldehyde production reactor is obtained by bubbling a stream of air at
1 atm through liquid methanol. The air leaves the vaporizer saturated with methanol and contains 42%

methanol by volume. The stream then passes through a heater in which its temperature is raised to
145°C. To avoid deactivating the catalyst, the maximum temperature attained in the reactor must be
limited to 600°C. For this purpose, saturated steam at 145°C is metered into the air–methanol stream,
and the combined stream enters the reactor. A fractional methanol conversion of 70.0% is achieved in
the reactor, and the product gas contains 5.00 mole% hydrogen. The product gas is cooled to 145°Cina
waste heat boiler in which saturated steam at 3.1 bar is generated from liquid water at 30°C. Several
absorption and distillation units follow the waste heat boiler, and formaldehyde is ultimately recovered
in an aqueous solution containing 37.0 wt% HCHO. The plant is designed to produce 36 metric kilotons
of this solution per year, operating 350 days/yr.

The reaction is exothermic, and if the heat of reaction is not removed in some way, the reactor
temperature could increase to an undesirably high level. To avoid this occurrence, the reaction is
carried out with the catalyst suspended in liquid ethyl chloride. As the reaction proceeds, most of the
heat liberated goes to vaporize the liquid, making it possible to keep the reaction temperature at or
below 50°C.
The stream leaving the reactor contains ethyl chloride formed by reaction and that vaporized in the
reactor. This stream passes through a heat exchanger where it is cooled to 0°C, condensing essentially

Solid oxide fuel cells(SOFC) have been proposed as an alternative energy technology for use in large
stationary power applications (1 to 10 MW of electrical power). These devices have an ion-conducting
ceramic material (such as yttria-stabilized zirconia) as the membrane that separates the anode from the
cathode, and typically operate at 500–1000°C. There are two advantages to operating fuel cells at such
high  temperatures:  They  can  be  powered  directly  by  fuels  besides  hydrogen,  including  carbon
monoxide  (which  poisons  the  platinum  catalyst  in  low-temperature  fuel  cells)  and  hydrocarbons,
and the heat produced by fuel cell inefficiencies can be recovered and used elsewhere in the plant.
In the SOFC shown in the followingfigure, a mixture containing 75 mole% hydrogen and the
balance carbon monoxide reacts with oxygen from air to produce water and carbon dioxide plus DC
electricity. The overall process is shown in the following schematic diagram, and a device consisting of
10 single fuel cells stacked in series is shown in Problem 9.19.

The process functions as follows:
Hydrogen and carbon monoxide at 25°C are preheated and fed to the anode compartments of the single
cells,  where  they  combine  with  oxygen  ions  that  have  come  through  membranes  that  separate  the
electrodes and form water and carbon dioxide plus free electrons. The membranes are permeable to
oxygen ions but impermeable to electrons. The fractional conversions of H
2
and CO are each 95.0%. The
reaction products and unconsumed fuel are transported from the anode compartments to an incinerator.
The electrons form at all but the last of the anodes of each cell andflow through a conducting plate to the
cathode of the adjacent cell. The electrons from the last cellflow through an external circuit that delivers
electricity to the devices being powered by the fuel cell and connects back to the cathode of thefirst cell.
Fifty percent excess air at 25°C is preheated and fed to each cell cathode, where the oxygen in the air
reacts with the electrons entering the cathode to produce the oxygen ions that permeate through the
membrane to the cell anode. The exit streams from the cathodes are combined and pass through the
air and fuel preheaters before being discharged to the atmosphere.

Citric  acid  (C

)  is  used  in  the  preparation  of  many  foods,  pharmaceuticals,  soft  drinks,  and
personal-care products. Although it can be recovered by concentration and crystallization from citrus
juices,  especially  lemons,  modern  commercial  production  involves  synthesis  by  fermentation  of
molasses or other carbohydrates such as glucose or fructose by the fungusAspergillus niger(A. niger).
The process involves addition of the fungus to a fermenter along with glucose, nutrients, water, and air
that is bubbled through the fermentation broth. After the desired conversion, the resulting liquor is
processedfirst byfiltration of the cell mass and other solids from the liquid and then recovery and
purification of the citric acid by crystallization.
As part of the evaluation of a proposed continuous fermentation process, you have been asked to
estimate the heating or cooling requirement associated with a fermenter that is to produce 10.0 kg of

Nitric oxide generated on dissolution of NO
2
in water is oxidized to produce additional NO
2
, which is
then combined with water to form more HNO
3
. In this problem we neglect side reactions that would
lower the product yield.
Ammonia vapor at 275°C and 8 atm is mixed with air, also at 275°C and 8 atm, and the combined
stream is fed to a converter. Fresh air entering the system at 30°C and 1 atm with a relative humidity of
50% is compressed to 100°C and 8 atm, and the compressed air then exchanges heat with the product
gas leaving the converter. The quantity of oxygen in the feed to the converter is 20% in excess of the
amount theoretically required to convert all of the ammonia to HNO
3
. The entire process after the
compressor may be taken to operate at a constant pressure of 8 atm.
In the converter, the ammonia is completely oxidized, with a negligible amount of NO
2
formed.
The product gas leaves the converter at 850°C, and, as described in the preceding paragraph, exchanges
heat with the air entering the system. The product gas then is fed to a waste-heat boiler that produces
superheated steam at 200°C and 10 bar from liquid water at 35°C. The product gas leaving the waste-
heat boiler is cooled further to 35°C and fed to an absorption column in which the NO is completely
oxidized to NO
2
, which in turn combines with water (some of which is present in the product gas).
Water is fed to the absorber at 25°C, at a rate sufficient to form a 55 wt% aqueous nitric acid solution.
The NO formed in the reaction of NO
2
to produce HNO
3
is oxidized, and the NO
2
produced is hydrated
to form still more HNO
3
. The off-gas from the process may be taken to contain only N

and O

product, waste-heat boiler producing superheated steam, exchanger cooling the product gas before
it is fed to the absorber, and absorber.

Before performing this calculation, determine if condensation of water occurs when the gas is

temperature of the product gas is reasonable.

The gas leaving the furnace is fed through a tall stack and discharged to the atmosphere. The ratioφ

another,  and  the  consequent  rapid  increase  in  temperature  in  the  cylinders  causes  the  combustion
products to expand and drive the pistons. The back-and-forth motion of the pistons is converted to
rotary motion of a crank shaft, motion that in turn is transmitted through a system of shafts and gears to
propel the car.
Consider a car driving on a day when the ambient temperature is 298 K and suppose that the rate of
heat loss from the engine to the outside air is given by the formula

and calculate the minimum feed rate of gasoline (gal/h) required to produce 100 hp of shaft work.
(b)If the exhaust gases are well above 298 K (which they are), is the work delivered by the pistons
more or less than the value determined in Part (a)? Explain.
(c)If the ambient temperature is much lower than 298 K, the work delivered by the pistons would
decrease. Give two reasons.

A city with a population of 200,000 people operates a 20:010

gal/day wastewater treatment plant.
For every million gallons of wastewater treated, 1875 lb
m
of solids are generated, with 75% of the
solids being classified as“volatile”(meaning they are converted to gases during digestion).
Solids  generated  in  the  treatment  plant  are  fed  to  an  anaerobic  digester  in  which  micro-
organisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. The feedto the digester
contains 45,000 mg solids/L at 55°F and has a density approximately that of water. The digester
operates at 95°F, converts 50% of the volatile solids to a biogas containing 65 vol% CH

and 35%
CO

at  a  rate  of  15  SCF  (standard  cubic  feet)  gas  per  lb

of  solids  converted,  and  loses
approximately 250,000 Btu/h of heat to the surroundings. To supply the heat needed to raise the
feed temperature from 55°Fto95°F and to make up for the heat loss, a stream of sludge is pumped
from the digester through a heat exchanger in which it comes into thermal contact with a stream of
hot water. The heated sludge is returned to the digester. The digester biogas is fed to a furnace in
which a fraction of it is burned to heat the water for the heat exchanger from 160°Fto180°F.

9.75.In a surface-coating operation, a polymer (plastic) dissolved in liquid acetone is sprayed on a solid
surface and a stream of hot air is then blown over the surface, vaporizing the acetone and leaving a
residual polymerfilm of uniform thickness. Because environmental standards do not allow discharging
acetone into the atmosphere, a proposal to incinerate the stream is to be evaluated.
The proposed process uses two parallel columns containing beds of solid particles. The air-acetone
stream,  which  contains  acetone  and  oxygen  in  stoichiometric  proportion,  enters  one  of  the  beds  at
1500 mm Hg absolute at a rate of 1410 standard cubic meters per minute. The particles in the bed have
been preheated and transfer heat to the gas. The mixture ignites when its temperature reaches 562°C, and
combustion takes place rapidly and adiabatically. The combustion products then pass through and heat the
particles in the second bed, cooling down to 350°C in the process. Periodically theflow is switched so that
the heated outlet bed becomes the feed gas preheater/combustion reactor and vice versa.

The heat required to sustain this endothermic reaction is provided by feeding oxygen to the reactor and
burning a portion of the methane to form primarily CO and some CO
2
.
A simplified version of the process is as follows. A stream of natural gas, which for the purposes of
this problem may be considered pure methane, and a stream containing 96.0 mole% oxygen and the
balance nitrogen are each preheated from 25°C to 650°C. The streams are combined and fed into an
adiabatic converter, in which most of the methane and all of the oxygen are consumed, and the product
gas is rapidly quenched to 38°C as soon as it emerges from the converter. The residence time in the
converter is less than 0.01 s, low enough to prevent most but not all of the methane from decomposing
to form hydrogen and solid carbon particles (soot). Of the carbon in the feed, 5.67% emerges as soot.
The cooled effluent passes through a carbonfilter in which the soot is removed. The clean gas is then
compressed  and  fed  to  an  absorption  column,  where  it  is  contacted  with  a  recycled  liquid  solvent,
dimethylformamide,  or  DMFMW73:09.  The  off-gas  leaving  the  absorber  contains  all  of  the
hydrogen and nitrogen, 98.8% of the CO, and 95% of the methane in the gas fed to the column. The“lean”
solvent fed to the absorber is essentially pure DMF; the“rich”solvent leaving the column contains all of
the water and CO

and 99.4% of the acetylene in the gas feed. This solvent is analyzed and found to contain

calculate (i) the requiredflow rates (SCMH) of the methane and oxygen feed streams; (ii) the molar

The wastewater treatment plant at the Ossabaw Paper Company paper mill generates about 24 tonnes
of sludge per day. Theconsistencyof the sludge is 35%, meaning that the sludge contains 35 wt% solids
and the balance liquids. The mill currently spends $40/tonne to dispose of the sludge in a landfill. The
plant environmental engineer has determined that if the sludge consistency could be increased to 75%,
the sludge could be incinerated (burned) to generate useful energy and to eliminate the environmental
problems associated with landfill disposal.

Process description:The sludge from the wastewatertreatment plant (Stream
A
) passes through a dryer
where a portion of the water in the sludge is vaporized. The heat required for the vaporization comes from
condensing saturated steam at 4.00 bar (Stream
B
). The steam fed to the dryer is produced in the plant’s
oil-fired boiler from feedwater at 20°C(Stream
C
). The heat required to produce the steam is transferred
from the boiler furnace, where fuel oil (Stream
D
) is burned with 25% excess air (Stream
E
). The
concentrated sludge coming from the dryer (Stream
F
), which has a consistency of 75%, is fed to an
incinerator. The heating value of the sludge is insufficient to keep the incinerator temperature high enough
for complete combustion, so natural gas (Stream
G
) is used as a supplementary fuel. A stream of outside
air at 25°C(Stream
H
)isheatedto110°C and fed to the incinerator along with the concentrated sludge
and natural gas. The waste gas from the incinerator is discharged to the atmosphere.
Fuel oil:The oil is a low-sulfur No. 6 fuel oil. Its ultimate (elemental) analysis on a weight basis is
87% C, 10% H, 0.84% S, and the balance oxygen, nitrogen, and nonvolatile ash. The higher heating
value of the oil is 3:7510
4
kJ/kg and the heat capacity isC
p
1:8 kJ/kg°C.
Boiler:The boiler has an efficiency of 62%, meaning that 62% of the heating value of the fuel oil
burned is used to produce saturated steam at 4.00 bar from boiler feedwater at 20°C. Fuel oil at 65°C
and dry air at 125°C are fed to the boiler furnace. The air feed rate is 25% in excess of the amount
theoretically required for complete consumption of the fuel.
Sludge:The sludge from the wastewater treatment plant contains 35% w/w solids (S) and the balance
liquids (which for the purposes of this problem may be treated as only water) and enters the dryer at
22°C. The sludge includes a number of volatile organic species, some of which may be toxic, and has
a terrible odor. The heat capacity of the solids is approximately constant at 2.5 kJ/(kg°C).
Dryer:The dryer has an efficiency of 55%, meaning that the heat transferred to the sludge,
_
Q
2
, is 55%
of the total heat lost by the condensing steam, and the remainder,
_
Q
3
, is lost to the surroundings. The
dryer operates at 1 atm, and the water vapor and concentrated sludge emerge at the corresponding
saturation temperature. The steam condensate leaves the dryer as a liquid saturated at 4.00 bar.
Incinerator:The concentrated sludge has a heating value of 19,000 kJ/kg dry solids. For a feed sludge of
75% consistency, the incinerator requires 195 SCM natural gas/tonne wet sludge1SCM1m
3
STP.
The theoretical air requirement for the sludge is 2.5 SCM air/10,000 kJ of heating value. Air is fed in 100%
excess of the amount theoretically required to burn the sludge and the natural gas.

(b)The money saved by implementing this process will be the current cost of disposing of the

installed costs of the new dryer and incinerator. What other costs must be taken into account
when determining the economic feasibility of the process? Why might management decide to
go ahead with the project even if it proves to be unprofitable?

Balances on Transient
Processes
A system  is said to be in atransient(orunsteady-state) condition if  the value of any system
variable changes with time. Batch and semibatch process systems are always transient: in a batch
system, if nothing is changing with time then nothing is happening, and in a semibatch system
(which has an input stream but no output stream or vice versa) at least the mass of the system
contents must vary with time. Continuous systems are always transient when they are started up
and shut down, and they become transient at other times due to planned or unexpected changes in
operating conditions.
1
The procedures for deriving balances on transient systems are essentially those developed in
Chapters  4  (material  balances)  and  7  (energy  balances).  The  main  difference  is  that  transient
balances  have  nonzero  accumulation  terms  that  are  derivatives,  so  that  instead  of  algebraic
equations the balances are differential equations.
10.0LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
Derive  material  balance  equations  and  provide  initial  conditions  for  well-mixed  transient
single-unit processes, and derive energy balance equations and provide initial conditions for
well-mixed transient single-unit nonreactive processes.
Predict  transient  system  behavior  by  inspecting  balance  equations.  For  example,  given  an
equation that has the form [dC

10.1THE GENERAL BALANCE EQUATION . . . AGAIN
In Section 4.2, the general balance equation (4.2-1) was given as
accumulationinputgenerationoutputconsumption
Two forms of this equation were discussed: differential balances, which relate instantaneous rates
of change at a moment in time, and integral balances, which relate changes that occur over afinite
time period. We examine in this section the nature of the relationship between these two types of
balances; in doing so, we belatedly show why they are called differential and integral.

In reality, the concept of a true steady state isfiction, since there arealwaysprocess variablefluctuations in real systems.
When you assume steady-state operation, you are assuming that thesefluctuations are small enough to be neglected without
causing serious errors in calculated values.

This is the general differential balance equation:Mis the amount of the balanced quantity in the
system, and the four terms on the right side are rates that may vary with time.
If Equation 10.1-2 is applied to a continuous system at steady state, the quantityMmust be a
constant,  its  time  derivative  therefore  equals  zero,  and  the  equation  reduces  to  the  familiar
equation introduced in Chapter 4:
inputgenerationoutputconsumption
However, as long as any term varies with time, the derivative on the left side of Equation 10.1-2
remains part of the equation. We conclude thatthe balance equation for an unsteady-state system
at an instant of time is a differential equation(hence the term differential balance).
Equation 10.1-2 is an ordinaryfirst-order differential equation. Before it can be solved to
yield an expression forMt,aboundary conditionmust be provided—a specified value of the
dependent variable (M) at some value of the independent variable (t). Frequently, the value ofM
at  timet0  (an“initial  condition”)  is  specified.  The  complete  balance  equation  would  be
Equation 10.1-2 followed by

When  you  analyze  a  transient  system,  your  analysis  is  not  complete  unless  every  differential
equation  you  derive  is  accompanied  by  a  boundary  condition  similar  to  one  of  those  just
given.
10.1  The General Balance Equation . . . Again571

The procedure  for deriving a  differential balance on an  unsteady-state  system normally
begins with three steps: (1) Delete terms from thegeneral balance equation that are either zero
or  negligible;  (2)  write  an  expression  for  the  total  amount  of  the  balanced  quantity  (mass,
particles, moles of a species, energy, etc.) in the system; and (3) differentiate the expression
with respect to time to determine the accumulation term. Thereafter, substitute expressions for
the  nonzero  terms  in  the  equation,  cancel  variables  if  possible,  and  formulate  a  boundary
condition  (or  an  initial  condition  att0).  The  next  example  gives  two  illustrations  of  this
procedure.

Example 10.1-2Water Balance on a City Reservoir
The  water  level  in  a  municipal  reservoir  has  been  decreasing  steadily  during  a  dry  spell,  and  local
meteorologists predict that the drought could continue for another 60 days. The water company estimates
that the consumption rate in the city is approximately 10

that rainfall and stream drainage into the reservoir coupled with evaporation from the reservoir should yield a
net water input rate of 10

which time the reservoir contained an estimated 10

(10.2-1)

In this equation, 1.50 mol/s would be the sum of the input and generation terms in the balance on

would be the sum of the output and consumption terms. The goal would
be to solve the differential balance to determine the concentrationC
A
mol/Las a function of time

This section reviews some calculus rules and procedures for solving differential equations
like Equation 10.2-1. In what follows,xis an independent variable,yxis a dependent variable,
andais a constant.
Rule 1:Derivative of a constant times a function

Consider a specific example:

10.2  Material Balances577

Novice calculus students are often tempted to solve this equation by doing something like

which is correct but useless, since you cannot evaluate that integral withoutfirst substituting for

The procedure for solving a separable equation is to bring all terms involvingy(includingdy)to

integrate each side over its respective variable from the initial value [0 forx,y0fory]toan

10.2c  Balances on Single Well-Mixed Process Units
Here is the general procedure for writing and solving a transient material balance equation:
1.Eliminate terms in the general balance equation that equal zero(input  and  output  for
batch  systems,  generation  and  consumption  for  balances  on  total  mass  and  nonreactive
species).
2.Write an expression for the total amount of the balanced species in the systemVm

mol A/m
3
orn
total
molx
A
mol A/molfor species A].Differentiate
the expression with respect to time to obtain the accumulation term in the balance equation.
3.Substitute system variables into the remaining terms(input, generation, output, consumption)
in the balance equation. Make sure that all terms have the same units (kg/s, lb-mole/h, etc.).
4.If ytis the dependent variable to be determined(e.g., the mass of the system contents, the
concentration of species A, the mole fraction of methane),rewrite the equation to obtain an
explicit expression for dy=dt.Supply a boundary condition—the  value  of  the  dependent
variable at a specified time (usuallyt0). This condition may be expressed as [t0,yy
0
]
or simply [y0y
0
], wherey
0
is a number.
5.Solve the equation—analytically if possible,otherwise numerically.  In  the  processes  to  be
analyzed in this chapter, you will generally be able to use separation of variables to obtain the
solution analytically.
6.Check the solution. You can do so using any (and preferably all) of these methods:
(a)Substitutet0 and verify that the known initial condition [y0y
0
] is obtained.
(b)Find the long-time asymptotic (steady-state) value of the dependent variable by setting
dy=dtequal to 0 in the original balance equation and solving the resulting algebraic
equation fory
ss
, and then verify that if you lett!1in your solution,y!y
ss
.(The
equation  may  not  have  a  steady-state  solution,  in  which  case  this  method  will  not
work.)
(c)Differentiate your solution to obtain an expression fordy=dt, substitute foryanddy=dtin
the original differential equation, and verify that the equation is satisfied.
7.Use your solution to generate a plot or table of y versus t.
The next example illustrates this procedure.

10.3ENERGY BALANCES ON SINGLE-PHASE NONREACTIVE

The general energy balance has the form

are the massflow rates of the system input and output streams. (If the system is closed, each
flow rate equals zero.) Proceeding as in the development of the transient mass balance equation,
we apply the general energy balance equation (10.3-1) to the system in a small time interval fromt
totΔt, during which time the properties of the input and output streams remain approximately
constant. The terms of the equation are as follows (see Section 7.4):

If we now substitute the given expressions for accumulation, input, and output into Equa-

It is quite difficult to solve Equation 10.3-2 unless a number of simplifications are made. We

massflow rate.

A consequence of this assumption is that the mass of the system contents does not change with

negligible.

_
W.
Equation 10.3-7 is simple in appearance, but its solution is still generally difficult to obtain.
If, for example, the composition or temperature of the system contents varies with position in
the  system,  it  is  difficult  to  express  the  total  internal  energyU
sys
in  terms  of  measurable
quantities, and a similar problem occurs if phase changes or chemical reactions take place in the
course of the process. To illustrate the solution of energy balance problems without becoming
too involved in these thermodynamic complexities, we will impose the additional restrictions
that follow.
3.The temperature and composition of the system contents do not vary with position within the
system (i.e., the system is perfectly mixed). In consequence, the outlet stream and the system
contents must be at the same temperature, or

To summarize, the conditions under which Equations 10.3-12 and 10.3-13 are valid are:

10.4SIMULTANEOUS TRANSIENT BALANCES
Throughout this book, we have seen that when more than one species is involved in a process or
when  energy  balances  are  required,  several  balance  equations  must  be  derived  and  solved
simultaneously.  For  steady-state  systems  the  equations  are  algebraic,  but  when  the  systems
are  transient,  simultaneous  differential  equations  must  be  solved.  For  the  simplest  systems,
analytical  solutions  may  be  obtained  by  hand,  but  more  commonly  numerical  solutions  are
required. Software packages that solve general systems of ordinary differential equations—such
as Mathematica


—are readily obtained for most computers.

tank isfilled to the desired level. The density of the feed stream is constant.

2.To predict the shape of the curve on a plot ofVversust, we need only remember that the slope of the
curve isdV=dt, which in turn equals
_
Vt(from Equation 1). Try to follow this chain of reasoning:
A point on the plot ofVversustis the initial condition (t0,V75 L).
During thefirst 10 seconds,dV=dt2:5t(from Equations 1 and 3a). The slope of the curve
therefore equals zero att0 (so that the curve is horizontal at theVaxis) and increases over the
first 10 seconds (so that the curve is concave up).
Att10 seconds,dV=dtreaches a value of 25 L/s and thereafter remains constant at that value.
A curve with a constant slope is a straight line. The plot ofVversustfort10 s must therefore be
a straight line with a slope of 25 L/s.
Putting  the  preceding  observations  together,  we  conclude  that  the  plot  ofVversuststarts
horizontally at (t0,V75 L), curves up for 10 seconds, and then becomes a straight line with a
slope of 25 L/s. It should have the following appearance:
V
(L)

t(s)
The plot ofC
A
versustmust begin at (t0,C
A
0), since the tank initially contains pure water.
Att0, the expression of Equation 2 fordC
A
=dtequals zero since bothtandC
A
are zero at
this  point.  (Verify.)  The  plot  ofC
A
versustis  therefore  horizontal  at  theC
A
axis.  Since
we  are  adding  A  to  the  tank,  its  concentration  must  increase,  and  so  the  curve  must  be
concave up.
As time proceeds, more and more of the tank volume is occupied byfluid in which the A has had a
long time to react. We could anticipate that at averylong time, the tank would contain a huge
volume with very little A in it, and the A being added would be diluted down to a concentration
approaching zero.C
A
should therefore increase neart0, rise to a maximum, start decreasing,
and approach zero at long times.
Furthermore,  the  concentration  in  the  tank  can  never  be  greater  than  that  in  the  feed  stream
(0.015 mol/L) and, in fact, must always be less than this amount since (a) the feed is diluted by the
water initially in the tank and (b) some of the A in the feed reacts once it is in the tank. The
maximum value ofC
A
must therefore be less than 0.015 mol A/L.
All of these observations combine to predict a plot with the following shape:

10.5  SUMMARY
All batch and semibatch processes are transient, as are continuous
processes being started up, shut down, or in transition from one
operating  state  to  another.  The  accumulation  terms  in  balance
equations for transient systems are not zero (as they are for steady-
state systems) but rather are derivatives of system variables with
respect to time, and balance equations are consequently differen-
tial rather than algebraic.
The procedure for writing and solving transient balances is as
follows:
Write an expression for the amount of the balanced quantity in
the system (mass, moles of a particular species, energy) and set
the  accumulation  term  in  the  balance  equation  equal  to  the
derivative of that amount with respect to time.
Substitute for the input, output, generation, and consumption
terms in the balance equation, and convert the resulting equa-
tion into one with the form

whereytis the dependent system variable to be determined
(total mass or volume of the system contents, concentration or
590CHAPTER 10Balances on Transient Processes

mole fraction of a species, temperature) andy
0
is the specified
initial value ofy.
Sketch  the  anticipated  plot  ofyversust,  using  the  initial
condition  to  locate  the  starting  point  and  using  what  you
know  about  the  slope  (which  equalsdy=dt)  to  predict  the
shape of the curve.
If  the  balance  equation  can  be  solved  analytically  (e.g.,  by
separation of variables and integration), do so; otherwise, solve
it using differential equation-solving software.
If the system involves more than one dependent variable (such
as a semibatch unit in which both the volume and composition
of  the  system  contents  vary  or  a  reactor  in  which  several
reactions  occur  simultaneously),  write  balance  equations  for
all the dependent variables and convert them to the form

PROBLEMS
Most of the following problems ask you to write one or more transient balances, provide initial conditions for
each derived equation, and integrate the equations. Whether or not such a problem explicitly requests it, you
should always check your solution by verifying that (a) the initial condition is satisfied, (b) differentiating
your solution yields the original balance equation, and (c) the previously determined steady-state solution
(if one has been determined) is approached ast!1in the transient solution.

A 7.35 million gallon tank used for storing liquefied natural gas (LNG, which may be taken to be pure
methane) must be taken out of service and inspected. All the liquid that can be pumped from the tank
isfirst removed, and the tank is allowed to warm from its service temperature of about260°Fto80°F
at 1 atm. The gas remaining in the tank is then purged in two steps: (1) Liquid nitrogen is sprayed
gently onto the tankfloor, where it vaporizes. As the cold nitrogen vapor is formed, it displaces the
methane in a piston-likeflow until the tank is completelyfilled with nitrogen. Once all the methane
has been displaced, the nitrogen is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. (2) Air is blown into the
tank where it rapidly and completely mixes with the nitrogen until the composition of the gas leaving
the tank is very close to that of air.
(a)Use the ideal-gas equation of state to estimate the densities of methane at 80°F and 1 atm and of
nitrogen at260°F and 1 atm. How confident are you about the accuracy of each estimate? Explain.
(b)If the density of liquid nitrogen is 50 lb

, how many gallons will be required to displace all the
methane from the tank?
(c)How many cubic feet of air will be required to increase the oxygen concentration to 20% by volume?
(d)Explain the logic behind vaporizing nitrogen in the manner described. Why purge with nitrogen
first as opposed to purging with air?

Here is how the drum works. The rate of drainage of a liquid from a container varies with the
height of the liquid in the container: the greater the height, the faster the drainage rate. The drum is
initially charged with enough liquid so that when the input rate has its desired value, the liquid level is
such that the drainage rate from the drum has the same value. A sensor in the drum sends a signal
proportional  to  the  liquid  level  to  a  control  valve  in  the  downstream  line.  If  the  inputflow  rate
increases, the liquid level starts to rise; the control valve detects the rise from the transmitted signal
and opens to increase the drainage rate, stopping when the level comes back down to its set-point
value. Similarly, if the inputflow rate drops, the control valve closes enough to bring the level back up
to its set point.
(a)The drum is to be charged initially with benzene (density0:879 g=cm

) at a constant rate
_
mkg/minuntil the tank is half full. IfL5m,r1m,and
_
m10 kg/min, how long should it
take to reach that point?
(b)Now  suppose  theflow  rate  into  the  tank  is  unknown.  A  sight  gauge  on  the  tank  allows
determination of the liquid level, and instructions are to stop theflow when the tank contains
3000 kg. At what value ofhshould this be done?
(c)After the tank has been charged, theflow rate into the drum,
_
m
1
, varies with upstream operations,
and theflow rate out is 10 kg/min. Write a mass balance around the drum so that you obtain a
relationship between
_
m

and the rate of change in the height of liquid in the tankdh=dtas a
function ofh. Estimate theflow rate into the tank whenhhas an approximate value of 50 cm, and
dh=dt1 cm/min. (Hint:Although an analytical solution is feasible, you mayfind it easier to
create   plots  ofVanddV=dhat  0.1  m  increments  inh,  which  can  be  used  in  obtaining  an
approximate solution to the problem.)
(d)Speculate on why the drum would provide better performance than feeding a signal proportional
to theflow rate directly to the control valve that would cause the valve to close if theflow rate
drops below the set point and to open if theflow rate rises above that point.

10.8.Water is added at varying rates to a 300-liter holding tank. When a valve in a discharge line is opened,
waterflows out at a rate proportional to the height and hence to the volumeVof water in the tank. The

input rate of 60.0 L/min the level just reaches the top but does not spill over. The input rate is then
abruptly decreased to 40.0 L/min.

emitting as much as 1.50 mol of sulfur dioxide into the room if a seal ruptures. An SO

Purification  of  proteins  for  use  as  biopharmaceuticals  is  often  accomplished  byion exchange
chromatography, in which a processfluid passes through a column packed with small resin beads
whose ionic surface charge causes them to adsorb some stream components more strongly than others.
An ion-exchange run takes place in two steps: (1) the load step, in which the process streamflows
through the column and the target protein (the product) and some undesired impurities are adsorbed
onto the resin; and (2) the elution step, during which anotherfluid passes through the column and

desorbs the impurities and the protein from the resin. The elutionfluid consists of an aqueous solution
of a solute known as Tris diluted with an NaCl solution, with the NaCl-to-Tris ratio starting at 0 and
steadily increasing with time. The impurities desorb into thefluid when the NaCl concentration is low,
and the effluent is collected in a waste vessel. As the NaCl concentration increases, the target protein
desorbs. When analysis of the effluent reveals the presence of the target protein, theflow is switched to
the product collection vessel, and the effluent is collected until no more product is detected in the
effluent.  The collected  product  is  then  subjected  to  additional  process  steps  to further  isolate  the
protein, and the column is cleaned for reuse.
Consider an elution step in which solutions of 1 M NaCl (solution A) and 50 mM Tris (solution B)
are mixed and fed to a loaded ion-exchange column. The system is programmed to keep the total

Oxygen required for cell growth and protein production is supplied in air fed at 22°C and 1.1 atm.
During the process, the gas leaving the bioreactor at 22°C and 1 atm is analyzed continuously. The

used to determine the Sf9 cell growth rate (a quantity difficult to measure directly) and consistency of
the operation from batch to batch.

the condensate emerges at its saturation temperature. A solvent with a heat capacity of 2.30 kJ/(kg°C)
is fed to the tank at a steady rate of 12.0 kg/min and a temperature of 25°C, and the heated solvent is
discharged at the sameflow rate. The tank is initiallyfilled with 760 kg of solvent at 25°C, at which

scale and reinstalled in the tank. The process described above is run again with the same steam
conditions, solventflow rate, and mass of solvent charged to the tank, and the temperature after 40
minutes is 55°C instead of the value calculated in Part (c). One of the system variables listed in the
problem statement must have changed as a result of the change in the stirrer. Which variable
would you guess it to be, and by what percentage of its initial value did it change?
10.30.At 9:30 one morning, a graduate student measures 350 grams of liquid benzene at 20°C into a glass
flask dirty enough that its contents cannot be seen, puts the openflask on a bunsen burner, turns the
burner on, and goes for a coffee break. The conversation at the break is lively, and he doesn’t get back
until 10:10 a.m. He looks down into theflask, sees the liquid is boiling, turns the burner off, feels a
little irritation in his eye and rubs the eye with his hand, picks up theflask, says“Ouch”(or something
roughly equivalent), puts theflask down on his laboratory partner’s thermodynamics homework, and
starts to prepare the next step of the experiment.
(a)Suppose the heat input rate to theflask contents is 40.2 W. Calculate the time at which the benzene
temperature reaches 40°C. Neglect evaporation of benzene during the heating and take the heat
capacity of liquid benzene to be constant at 1.77 J/(g°C).
(b)Calculate the quantity of benzene left in theflask at 10:10 a.m., assuming that once the benzene
starts boiling, the rate of heat input to theflask (40.2 W) equals the rate of vaporization (g/s) times
the heat of vaporization (J/g).
(c)The graduate student was lucky. First, neither his faculty advisor nor the departmental safety
officer came into the laboratory during this episode. More importantly, he was still alive and well
at the end of the day. Identify as many of his safety violations as you can, explaining the danger
and suggesting for each violation what he should have done instead.

Computational Techniques
This  appendix  introduces  several  mathematical  concepts  and  methods  that  have  widespread
applicability in the analysis of chemical processes. The presentation presumes a knowledge of
elementary calculus, but not of linear algebra or numerical analysis. The student who wishes a
broader or deeper treatment of the subjects discussed is advised to refer to a numerical analysis
reference.
Appendix A.1THE METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES
In this section we outline a statistical technique forfitting a straight line toyversusxdata. You
should be aware, however, that in doing so we are barely scratching the surface of thefield of
statistical analysis; we will not discuss techniques forfitting functions of several variables, for
determining  quantitatively  the  uncertainties  associated  with  afit,  or  for  comparing  alternative
functions used tofit a given data set.
Suppose you measureyat four values ofx, plot the data on a graph ofyversusx, and draw a
line through the data points.

Ifd

below the line, and ifd

equals zero the line passes through the point. A line is said tofit the data
well if the values of most of the residuals are close to zero.
There are several ways to determine the line that bestfits a set of data, which differ primarily
in their definitions of“best.”The most common method is themethod of least squares.

the best line through the data is the one that minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals.

We could also choose the best line as the one that minimizes the sum of the absolute values of the residuals, or the sum of
the fourth powers of the residuals. Using the squares simply provides computational convenience.

In this and the next several sections, we will discuss methods for solving one nonlinear equation in
one unknown. Extensions to multivariable problems will be presented in Section A.2i.
Suppose you have to solve an equation of the formfx0—that is,find the root or roots of
the functionfx. [Any equation can be written in this form by bringing every term to the left side.
For example,xe

versusxand to locate by graphical interpolation the point at which the curve crosses the axis.

which is particularly useful when you are dealing with functions that have several roots.

method to detect the existence and approximate location of multiple roots. Therefore, unless you
know that only one root exists, or you know the approximate location of each root you need to

more precise root-finding methods.

A.2c  Spreadsheet Solution
If  you  have  access  to  a  spreadsheet  program,finding  solutions  of  nonlinear  single-variable
equations is relatively easy. If the equation has the formfx0, you need only enter a guessed
value ofxin one cell of the spreadsheet, insert the formula forfxin an adjacent cell, and then
vary the value in thefirst cell until the value in the second cell is close enough to zero to meet a
specified convergence criterion. The next example illustrates this approach.
Example A.2-1Spreadsheet Solution of a Nonlinear Equation
Estimate the solution of the equationxe

using a spreadsheet.
SolutionThefirst step is to express the equation in a formfx0 by bringing all terms to one side of the equation.
The result is

We might set up the spreadsheet as follows, taking an initial guess of 1.0 for the solution of the equation.

xf(x)

The formula entered in Cell B2 would be=A2–exp (A2). As the value ofxin Cell A2 is changed, the value
offxin Cell B2 changes accordingly. The strategy is tofind the value in Cell A2 that drives the value in Cell
B2 satisfactorily close to zero. If this is done, the following result is obtained:

The desired solution is
x0:56714  , for whichfx0:0000052. If we wanted a more precise solution
we could add a sixth significantfigure to the given value ofx, but it is rare to need evenfive significant
figures.
The solution is even easier to obtain if the spreadsheet program is equipped with agoalseektool. Once
thefirst of the spreadsheets shown above has been constructed, selectGoal Seek(it can normally be found
under the pull-down“Tools”menu), and enterB2as the target cell, 0.0 as the target, andA2as the variable
cell. The spreadsheet will then search for and (usually) converge on the solution within a fraction of a second.
One  limitation  to  this  method  (and  to  all  other  numerical  methods  for  solving  nonlinear
equations) is that once you have found one solution, you cannot be sure that there are no additional
solutions. The way to determine the existence of multiple roots is to evaluatefxover a wide
range  ofxvalues  andfind  the  intervals  in  whichfxchanges  sign  (see  the  secondfigure  in
612APPENDIX AComputational Techniques

the  previous  section). Initial guesses can then  be made  within each of these  intervals  and the
spreadsheet used to determine the roots precisely.

Regula-falsiMethod
In this and the next subsection, we outline algorithms forfinding roots of single-variable equations
of the formfx0. Thefirst procedure, termed theregula-falsi method, is appropriately used
when an analytical expression for the derivative offwith respect toxis not available—as, for

A.2f  Successive Substitution and
Modified Successive Substitution
Problems involving the solution of nonlinear equations can often be expressed in the form
xfx
wherefxis  a  nonlinear  function.  (Example: xe
x
.)  As  shown  in  Chapter  10,  balance
equations for multiple unit processes with recycle often fall into this category:xwould be the
assumed value of a tear stream variable, andfxwould be the value generated by calculating
around the cycle.
The simplest solution method issuccessive substitution. An initial estimate,x
1
, is selected;
fx
1
is calculated; and the calculated value is used as the next estimate of the root. The formula is
x
i1
fx
i
(A.2-3)
The procedure is repeated until the specified convergence criterion is satisfied.
Sometimes  successive  substitution  works  very  well,  converging  in  a  few  steps.  Three
unsatisfactory convergence patterns are also observed from time to time, however. In thefirst,
the successive estimates oscillate about a central value:
37:6;2:3;36:8;2:6;34:4;2:9;...
The root lies somewhere between 3 and 30, but the procedure will clearly take a large number of
iterations to get there.
The  problem  here  is  that  successive  substitution  generates  overly  large  steps.  Instead  of
jumping all the way from 37.6 to 2.3, as successive substitution dictates, we should only go part of
the way from thefirst to the second value to obtain our estimate ofx
2
. To do this, we may use
modified successive substitution(also called damped successive substitution). The formula is
x

(A.2-4)
616APPENDIX AComputational Techniques

wherep, thedamping parameter, is a number between 0 and 1. Ifp1, the procedure reduces to
pure successive substitution, and aspapproaches zero, the size of the step becomes smaller and
smaller. A few trial-and-error iterations should yield a good value ofpfor a specific problem.
The  second  case  of  slow  convergence  in  successive  substitution  involves  a  creeping
progression, such as
151:7;149:5;147:4;145:6;143:8;...
Again, it appears that the procedure could be converging to a solution, but it is equally clear that it
is in no hurry to get there.
The remedy for this problem is toacceleratethe convergence procedure—to jump over many
of the intermediate solutions to which continued successive substitution would lead. The next
section outlines Wegstein’s method, one of the most commonly used acceleration algorithms.
The  third  unsatisfactory  convergence  pattern  is  instability.  For  example,  if  successive
substitution yields a sequence like
1:0;2:5;6:8;23:5;97:0;...
then successive substitution will clearly not work, no matter how many iterations are attempted. A
betterfirst  estimate  might  yield  a  convergent  sequence,  or  the  problem  might  be  intrinsically
unstable and must be restructured or solved by a different technique. Texts on numerical analysis
outline  stability  conditions  for  nonlinear  equation  solution  algorithms;  their  consideration  is
beyond the scope of this appendix.

A.2h  Convergence Criteria
A  problem  common  to  all  iterative  computational  methods  is  knowing  when  to  quit.  An
iterative method rarely yields a precise root,but rather gives successive approximations that
(if the method converges) approach the root more and more closely. Whether you are doing
the  calculation  by  hand  or writing  a  program  to  do  it, you  must specify  how close  is  close
enough.
Suppose  we  wish  tofind  a  solution  of  the  equationfx0  using  a  method  that  gives
successive estimatesx
1
,x
2
, and so on. Several different criteria may be used to determine when
to terminate the procedure. The most straightforward one calls for termination when the absolute
value offx
i
falls within a specified interval aboutf0:
jfx
i
j<ε(A.2-7)
whereε, theconvergence tolerance, is chosen to be several orders of magnitude smaller than
typical  values  offxin the  range  being  searched.  Decreasing  the  value  ofεleads  to a  more
accurate estimate of the solution but increases the number of steps (and hence computation time)
required to get there. There are formal ways to choose the value ofε, but it can be just as easy to
choose a value (e.g., 0.0001 times the value offat thefirst guessed value ofx),find the root, then
decrease the value ofεby a factor of 10, search again starting with the previous converged value,
and see if the solution changes enough to care about.
The convergence criterion (A.2-7) may yield a false solution if the functionfxis almost
horizontal over a wide range around the root, so thatjfx
i
jmay be less thanε(meeting the
convergence criterion) whenx
i
is still a long way from the root. In this case, one of the following
618APPENDIX AComputational Techniques

convergence criteria might be more appropriate to use:
jx
i
x
i1
j<ε(A.2-8)
jx
i
x
i1
j
x
i
<ε(A.2-9)
Equation  A.2-8  is  anabsolute convergence criterion.If  the  value  ofxchanges  by  less
thanεfrom one iteration to the next, the procedure is terminated and the last value ofxis taken
to be the desired root. The strictness of this criterion for a givenεdepends on the magnitude of
the estimated values. Ifε0:01, for example, and successive estimates ofxare 358,234.5 and
358,234.6, the procedure would not be terminated, even though the estimates are undoubtedly
close enough for any realistic purpose. On the other hand, successive estimates of 0.0003 and
0.0006 would lead to termination for the same value ofε, despite the fact that the two estimates
differ by a factor of two.
Equation A.2-9, arelative convergence criterion, avoids this difficulty. If this criterion is
used,  a value ofε0:01 specifies that the  procedure will be terminated when  the value  ofx
changes from one iteration to the next by less than 1%, regardless of the magnitude of that value.
This criterion does not work if successive estimates ofxconverge to a value of zero.
A.2i  Multivariable Root-Finding Algorithms
Solvingnnonlinear  equations  innunknowns  is  usually  a  difficult  problem,  and  a  general
treatment is well beyond the  scope  of this  text. In this  section  we  present several approaches
without proof or much explanation. For additional details, standard texts on numerical analysis
should be consulted.
Three methods that can be used tofind the values ofx
1
;...;x
n
that satisfynsimultaneous
equations  are  extensions  of  methods  given  previously  for  single-variable  problems.  They  are
(a)  successive  substitution,  (b)  the  Wegstein  algorithm,  and  (c)  the  Newton–Raphson  method
(a multivariable extension of Newton’s rule). The example that concludes this section illustrates
all three algorithms.

(A.2-10)
(A  cycle  withntear  stream  variables  falls  into  this  category.)  The  successive  substitution
method  consists  of  assuming  values  for  each  of  thenunknown  variables,  evaluating  the
functionsf
1
;...;f
n
, and using the calculated values as the next estimates of the variables. The
procedure is terminated when all variable values meet a specified convergence criterion. For
example,  ifx
k
i
is  the  value  of  theith  variable  at  thekth  iteration,  the  procedure  might  be
terminated when

This approach is simple but generally inefficient. The greater the number of variables, the longer it
takes  for  the  procedure  to  converge,  if  it  converges  at  all.  It  is  generally  preferable  to  use
Wegstein’s method or the Newton–Raphson method, depending on whether or not the partial
derivatives of the functionsf
1
;...;f
n
can be evaluated analytically. (Use Newton–Raphson if they
can be, otherwise try Wegstein, but don’t be too surprised if it doesn’t converge.)
Appendix A.2  Iterative Solution of Nonlinear Algebraic Equations619

Wegstein Algorithm.If  the  equations  to  be  solved  have  the  form  of  Equation  A.2-10  [i.e.,
x
i
f
i
x
1
;x
2
;...;x
n
], guess values for allnvariables and apply the procedure of Section A.2g
separately to each variable. Terminate when the convergence criteria are satisfied for all variables.
This procedure will work reasonably well if the generating functionf
1
depends almost entirely
onx
1
;f
2
depends only onx
2
, and so on (i.e., if there is little interaction among the variables). If this
is not the case, convergence will generally be very difficult to achieve.

The Newton–Raphson method is based on a linearization of the functionsg

about
each estimated set of roots and a solution of the resulting linear equations to get the next estimate.
(If you have no idea what all that means, don’t worry about it.) It is an efficient procedure to use

there is only one equationn1, the algorithm reduces to Newton’s rule (Section A.2e).
The  next  example  illustrates  the  three  multivariable  nonlinear  equation-solving  methods
described in this section.

In each case, use a starting valuex2;y2and stop when the relative changes inxandyfrom one
iteration to the next are each less than 0.001. (See Equation A.2-11.)
Solution1.Successive substitution.The  equationsg

where the subscript“a”stands for assumed and“c”stands for calculated. We assume values ofxandy,
recalculatexandyusing these expressions, and iterate until convergence is achieved. The calculation
proceeds as follows:

81.1332.6921.1322.693
91.13202.69291.13142.6928
Since  the  relative  changes  inxandyin  the  last  iteration  are  each  less  than  0.001,  the  calculation  is
terminated at this point, and thefinal values are accepted as the roots of the two given equations.
2.Wegstein algorithm.The same functions are used to generate calculated values ofxandyfrom assumed
values, only now the equations of Section A.2g are used to generate new assumed values after thefirst
iteration. The results are as follows. (Check thefirst series of numbers with a hand calculator to make sure
you know how to apply the formulas.)

In this case, Wegstein’s method did not accelerate the convergence. In fact, the large jump in the value ofx
in iteration 3 (when the Wegstein procedure wasfirst used) could have been thefirst symptom of an
instability, but the algorithm recovered well.

The superiority of the Newton–Raphson method to others tested is clear in this example and is even more
dramatic  when more than two  equations are to be solved simultaneously. Generally,  when analytical
derivatives are available, the Newton–Raphson method should be used for solving multiple nonlinear
algebraic equations.
622APPENDIX AComputational Techniques

Appendix A.3NUMERICAL INTEGRATION
In Chapter 8, we showed that the enthalpy change associated with the heating or cooling of a
substance  is  evaluated  by  integrating  the  substance  heat  capacityC
p
Tfrom  the  initial
temperature to thefinal temperature. This is one of many instances you will encounter in process
analysis where an integration is required as part of a problem solution.
It  often  happens  that  required  values  of  definite  integrals  cannot  be  obtained  using  the
methods of elementary calculus. If, for example, you are called on to evaluate something like
Z
10
0
e
x
3
dx
you will notfind help in a calculus book or a table of integrals—an analytical expression for the
integral of expx

simply does not exist.
It is possible, however, to substitute for any mathematical operation such as differentiation or
integration  a  series  of  arithmetic  operations  that  yield  approximately  the  same  result.  The
arithmetic operations are usually simple but numerous and repetitious and so are ideally suited
to computers.
A.3a Quadrature
The general problem we will discuss is the evaluation of a definite integral:

be a nonintegrable analytical function, such as expx
3
, or it may be a series of tabulatedx;y
data points or a plot ofyversusx.
A method ofnumerical integration(orquadrature, as it is also called) is required to evaluateI
in any of these cases. The specific techniques we will present are algebraic, but the general approach
to the problem is best visualized graphically. For the moment, we will suppose that all we have
relatingxandyis a table of data points, which we may graph on a plot ofyversusx.

The integral we are trying to evaluate (Iof Equation A.3-1) equals the area under the continuous
curve ofyversusx, but this curve is not available—we only know the function values at the
discrete data points. The procedure generally followed is tofit approximating functions to the data
points, and then to integrate these function analytically.
The many existing quadrature formulas differ only in the choice of functions tofit to the data
points. Two of the simplest approximations are tofit straight lines between successive points and
sum the area under the lines, and tofit parabolas to successive triplets of points and sum the areas
under the parabolas. These approximations lead to the quadrature formulas known respectively as
thetrapezoidal ruleandSimpson’s rule. We will discuss each in turn.

betweenaandb, the approximating series of lines would follow the dashed curve much more
closely, and the estimate of the integral would accordingly be more accurate.

Appendix A.3  Numerical Integration625

If you happen to have an even number of data points, you may integrate over all but thefirst or last
subinterval (omit whichever subinterval contributes least to the integral) using Simpson’s rule, and
over the remaining subinterval using the trapezoidal rule.

The data points are evenly spaced in the independent variableT, so that Simpson’s rule can be applied to the

p
increases with temperature, we will apply the less accurate trapezoidal rule
to the interval from 20°Cto50°C and use Simpson’s rule between 50°C and 230°C. IfΔT(=30°C) is the

The trapezoidal rule is exact if the function to be integrated is in fact linear in each interval
between data points, while Simpson’s rule is exact if the real function is parabolicor cubicin each
interval. (The latter point is far from obvious; for proof, see any reference on numerical analysis.)
A.3d  Numerical Integration of Analytical Functions
When you have an analytical expression for an integrandyxbut you cannot perform the integration
fromxatoxbanalytically, the procedure is to evaluateyataseriesofvaluesofxfromato
b—that is, to generate a data table—and then to use a quadrature formula such as Simpson’sruleto
estimate the integral. Now, however, you have the choice of the number of evaluations ofyxto make.
As a rule, the accuracy of a quadrature formula increases with the number of points in the
interval of integration, but so does the required computation time. Choosing the number of points
to  provide  a  suitable  combination  of  accuracy  and  low  computation  time  can  be  done  using
sophisticated numerical analysis techniques, but simple trial and error often suffices very well. A
common procedure is to evaluate the integral using (say) 9 points, then 17, then 33, and so on

5.When the can is opened,Pimmediately decreases to atmospheric
pressure. At the lower pressure, CO
2
is less soluble in the
liquid, and so bubbles of CO
2
emerge. As the concentration
of dissolved CO
2
(x
CO
2
) approaches its equilibrium value, the
bubbling slows down. Over a longer time period, the can warms up
and the mole fraction of CO
2
in the gas above the liquid decreases
as the gas mixes with air. Both of these phenomena decrease the
solubility of CO
2
even more, and bubbles continue to emerge.
Eventuallyy
CO

is close to zero, almost no dissolved CO
2
remains
in the liquid, and the soda goesflat.

5.Antifreeze lowers the freezing point and raises the boiling point
of water, so the radiator is less likely to freeze in winter and to
boil in summer.

2.The  second sentence  is  wrong and thefirst sentence  is correct,
but only if the reactants and products are at the same temperature.
The energy released by the breaking of reactant bonds and forming
of product bonds must be transferred from the reactor to keep
the products at the same temperature; otherwise it remains in the
reactor and raises the product temperature. If the reactor is adia-
batic, the products at the higher temperature would be at thesame
energy level as the reactants at the lower temperature.

1.The product temperature when the fuel is burned completely in
an adiabatic reactor.
2.Heat loss through reactor walls, incomplete reaction.
3.With an air feed, the heat released from combustion of afixed
amount (say, 1 mol) of fuel goes into heating the nitrogen in the
air as well as the reaction products and excess oxygen, whereas
only the latter must be heated for a pure O
2
feed. If afixed
quantity of heat is added to a greater amount of material, the
resulting temperature rise must be less.

(a)Ignition—abrupt increase in the rate of an oxidation
reaction.
(b)Ignition temperature—the temperature at which ignition
occurs when a combustible mixture is heated slowly.
(c)Ignition lag—time between a mixture reaching its ignition
temperature and the occurrence of ignition.
(d)Flammability limits—composition limits outside of which
ignition or explosion cannot occur.
(e)Flash point of a liquid—temperature at which a liquid gives
off enough vapor to form an ignitable mixture with the air
above the liquid surface.
2.
(a)An explosion or ignition; no reaction would occur.
(b)Yes; the reaction would cease.
(c)There is a region between the emerging jet (pure methane)
and the bulk of the room air (almost no methane) within
which the methane fraction falls between theflammability
limits. Theflame persists in this region.
p. 529
1.Aflame is a combustion zone in which various species
undergo transitions from states of high energy to states of
lower energy. The energy lost in the transitions is given off as
visible light.
2.In low-temperatureflames, which occur when the fuel and
oxygen are not well mixed, carbon particles are formed and
remain unburned, but the heat in the reaction zone raises them
to a temperature at which they glow incandescently. The result
is a yellowflame. At higher combustion temperatures, various
intermediate species are formed and excited to high-energy
states, and emit blue light as they return to lower states. The
result is a blueflame.
3.In a detonation, a pressure front (shock wave) forms and propa-
gates at supersonic speed, rapidly compressing and igniting the
flammable mixture and giving the appearance of an instantaneous
combustion. In the vicinity of the detonation, the force of the shock
wave can demolish a building or propel a bullet. The noise is the
vibration of the eardrums caused by the shock wave.
4.The rate of the reaction depends strongly on temperature; at
room temperature it is immeasurably low.
