2.1  Tensor fields, parallel transport
So far we have been constructing the tensor algebra from a tangent space at one pointPon the manifold
M.  Now we want to pick another point,Q, construct an analogous tensor algebra there, and then
compare tensors at those different points.
Begin with the definition of the concept of afield. Atensor fieldis a map from the manifoldM
into a tensor algebraT:
F:M→T,P7→T(P),
whereP∈M.
Since at every point the tensor algebra has the structure
T(P) =T
0,0
⊕T
1,0
⊕T

⊕. . . ,
the fieldFalso naturally splits into a direct sum of ascalar  field,vector  field, 1-form field, and
all othertensor fields, according to the nontrivial part of its codomain. Essentially, a tensor field is
specified once one has attached some tensor to every point on amanifold, each tensor being the element
of appropriate tensor algebra at that point.
One can naturally ask the question how to compare the value ofa, say, vector field at two different
pointsPandQ. The values of the field, although both being vectors, at the two points belong to two
different and unrelated spaces, so one cannot just “subtract” them. Such operation is defined only within
a tensor algebraat one point, not across several points.
In order to address this issue, one needs to define the idea of specifying what vectors are to be
considered “the same” in two different points. This process is calledparallel transport. In order to
specify a rule for parallel trasport, take some set of basis vectorse
e
e
μ
(Q)∈TM
Q
, and specify how do
those vectors “look” when one moves them slightly into a neighboring pointPwhich is separated from
Pby some infinitesimal “distance”dx
ν
in the direction of thee
e
e
ν
(P) vector:
e
e
e
μ
(Q)≡e
e
e
μ
(P) +Γ
λ
μν
(P)dx
ν
e
e
e
λ
(P),whereQ≡P+dx
ν
e
e
e
ν
(P).
Note:
•In the above equationindexνis fixed, and not summed over, despite repeating twice!
•The “distance” parameterdx
ν
is defined as a parameter of a coordinate curve joiningPandQ,
whilee
e
e
ν
(P) is the tangent vector to that curve atP. We have not introduced yet the “real” notion
of “metric distance” between points on a manifold, so this isthe best we can do at the moment.
•The coefficientsΓ
λ
μν
that define the actual correspondence betweene
e
e
μ
(Q) ande
e
e
μ
(P) are called
connection coefficients. They may be specified differently from point to point, so are therefore
functions ofP.

•When one constructs the vector atPstarting from a vector atQand using connection coefficients,
it is said that thevector is parallely transported fromQtoP.
•As the connection coefficients depend on indexν, they may be different when one transports a
vector fromQto different directions.  Therefore,parallel  transport  depends  on  the  path
along which the vector is being transported.
•Connection coefficients are not components of any tensor, despite their index-like notation.
There is no geometric object in tensor algebra at a point thatwould correspond to these. We shall
discuss this issue further below.
Once we have specified the rule for parallel transport of basis vectorse
e
e
μ
, we can easily construct the
appropriate rule for the parallel transport of basis 1-formse
e
e
μ
(Q)∈TM
∗
Q
into the pointP. This is done
simply by using the requirement that the parallely transported basis of 1-forms should be biorthogonal
to the paralelly transported basis of vectors. Therefore, we have:
e
e
e
μ
(Q)≡e
e
e
μ
(P)−Γ
μ
λν
(P)dx
ν
e
e
e
λ
(P),whereQ≡P+dx
ν
e
e
e
ν
(P).
Note that the sign in front of the connection coefficients is changed from plus to minus.
At this point we have all the neccessary pieces to perform a parallel transport of any vector (and
indeed, any tensor) by keeping its components fixed and transporting the basis. For example, ifA
A
A(Q) =
A
μ
(Q)e
e
e
μ
(Q), we have:

(P), sinceA

order differentials (which can be neglected).
Similarly, one can calculate the components of any parallely transported tensor, simply by transporting
each of the vectors in its basis. Once transported to the pointQ, the vectorA
A
Acan then be compared
to some other vector residing at that point. This is the basiswe need in order to define the concept of a
derivativeof a tensor field.
2.2  Covariant and exterior derivatives, commutators
The notation of parallel transport may be somewhat cumbersome and confusing. Therefore, rewrite the
rule for parallel transport of basis vectors in the form
e
e
e
μ
(Q)−e
e
e
μ
(P) =Γ
λ
μν
(P)dx
ν
e
e
e
λ
(P),
or in the form
e
e
e
μ
(Q)−e
e
e
μ
(P)
dx
ν
=Γ
λ
μν
(P)e
e
e
λ
(P).
Now given thatdx
ν
is considered infinitesimal, and sinceQ≡P+dx
ν
e
e
e
ν
(P), we can take the limit
dx
ν
→0 and write the above as
lim
dx
ν
→0
e
e
e
μ
(P+dx

Now we have all the ingredients to construct adirectional derivative of a vector field, in the
following way. Let a vector fieldA
A
A(M) be specified. At pointQit has the valueA
A
A(Q), while at pointP
it has the valueA
A
A(P). We want to subtract those two vectors, take the ratio with respect to “distance”
betweenPandQ, and take the limit when this distance goes to zero. But we cannot just subtract vectors
in different points. Instead,first perform parallel transportof the vectorA
A
A(Q) into the pointP, and
then subtractfrom it the actual valueA
A
A(P) that the vector field has at that point. In other words,

This being the definition, the rules for actual calculation of directional derivative are much more conve-
nient when expressed using the above formulas for parallel transport of basis vectors. Pick a coordinate
system at pointPon the manifold, and express the vector field in the formA

(x)e

(x). Then
calculate the directional derivative using the “chain rule”:

Evaluating this atx=x(P) we see that it is identical to the definition calculation. Note that in the first
term the directional derivative acts on an ordinary function just like an ordinary derivative.
The elegance of the latter method is obvious, and we can use itto calculate the directional derivative
of anarbitrary tensor. For example, given a tensor fieldA
A
A∈T
2,1
, one can calculate its directional
derivative as follows:

One can understand the structure of this expression in the following way:
•The first term is the ordinary derivative of a function.
•For every “up” index inA
μν
λ
add one term of the formΓ A, where this index appears as an upper
one onΓ, while the corresponding one onAis contracted to a first lower index ofΓ.
•For every “down” index inA
μν
λ
subtract one term of the formΓ A, where the index appears as a
first lower onΓ, while the corresponding one onAis contracted to the upper index ofΓ.
•The second lower index on allΓis always the index of the differentiation.

The above construction is unique, and the procedure of “correcting indices” with connection coefficients
corresponds precisely to differentiating the basis vectorsand 1-forms of a tensor.
Note that from the above formula it is obvious thatΓare not components of a tensor!Indeed,
it is easy to verify that the transformation rule forΓ

is:

These rules, in addition to the usual linearity and Leibniz rule, allow one to construct a gradient of any
tensor field, and consequently any kind of derivative withintensor algebra.
Note that the gradient of a vector is a (1,1)-tensor, and in general the gradient of a (p, q)-tensor is a
(p, q+ 1)-tensor.

on the choice of the basis, and their components are connection coefficients, which do not transform
as components of a tensor. Nevertheless, we shall see below that connection 1-forms are very useful in
practical calculations.

, but one adapted to thealgebra
of  differential forms, Λ

. Its explicit construction is similar to the above step-by-step construction
of the gradient, and we are not going to deal with it. Instead,like for the gradient, we shall provide
simple computational rules which cover the action of this operator on functions and basis 1-forms, and
consequently everything else will follow from these rules.
Introduce this operator, calledexterior derivativeand denotedd

•Let double exterior derivative be zero:

This last rule is actually the statement that ordinary partial derivatives should commute, written
in the language of differential forms.

There is one more important remark to be made with respect to commutation coefficients.  Note
that the exterior derivative (or a gradient) of a 0-form is a 1-form, which can act on a basis vector as a
functional, according to the biorthogonality relation:

e
e

[e

Now if we remember that we actually introduced the basis vectorse
e
e
μ
as partial differential operators
along the coordinate curves,
e
e
e
μ
≡
∂
∂x
μ
,
we can introduce “action” of a vector on a functionfas:
e
e
e
μ
[f] =∂
μ
f.
Comparing this to the action ofd
d
dfone
e
e
μ
we see thatd
d
df[e
e
e
μ
] =e
e
e
μ
[f] in the coordinate basis. Choosing
fto be precisely the coordinate curvex
ν
, we have:
d

ν
[e
e
e
μ
] =e
e
e
μ
[x

=δ

.
But this is nothing else than the biorthogonality relation itself,e
e
e
ν
[e
e
e
μ
] =δ
ν
μ
, which means that the
coordinate basis vectorse
e
e
μ
≡∂
μ
have the following corresponding basis 1-forms:
e
e
e
ν
=d
d
dx
ν
.
Using the ruled
d
dd
d
d= 0 we can now calculate thatin a coordinate basis all commutation coefficients
are zero:
c
λ
μν
= 0.
The opposite is also valid —if the commutation coefficients are zero, the basis is a coordinate
basis, ie. there exists a set of coordinate curvesx
μ
such that
e
e
e
μ
=
∂
∂x
μ
ande
e
e
μ
=d
d
dx
μ
.
In general, the above action of a basis vector on a functionfsimply produces another function, on
which another basis vector can act. We can therefore introduce thecommutatorof basis vectors as:
[e
e
e
μ
,e
e
e
ν
]f=e
e
e
μ
[e
e
e
ν
[f]]−e
e
e

[e

e

[f]].

One can show that the following identity is satisfied:
[e
e
e
μ
,e
e
e
ν
] =c
λ
μν
e
e
e
λ
Thus, in the coordinate basise
e
e
μ
≡∂
μ
we see again that commutation coefficients are zero, due to the
commutativity of partial derivatives.
Therefore, one can have a convenient criterion to verify whether a given basis is coordinate or non-
coordinate — basis is a coordinate basis iff the commutation coefficients are all zero. Given the above
formula, those commutation coefficients can be easily calculated.
As a final remark, note that one can extend the idea “basis vector acts on a function” to the idea of
“arbitrary vector acts on a function” simply by expanding the vector in a basis:
A
A
A[f] =A
μ
e
e
e
μ
[f].
Consequently, one can define acommutator of two vectorsas:
[A
A
A,B
B
B]f=
(
A
μ
e
e
e
μ
[B
λ
]−B

e
e
e
ν
[A

B

c

μν
)
e
e
e
λ
[f].
From this one sees that the commutator of two vectors is a vector. The commutator of vectors is also
calledLie bracket.
2.3  Curvature and torsion

its parallel-transported image in a nearby point in a given direction. Therefore, the statement that the

Chapter 3
The metric
3.1  Principle of equivalence, the metric tensor
General theory of relativity is based on two important principles — theprinciple of general relativity,
which has been mentioned before, and theequivalence principle:
Theequivalence principlestates:
At every point in an arbitrary gravitational field there exists a ref-
erence frame (the so-called locally inertial frame) in which all laws
of physics reduce to the form as given in special theory of relativity.
There are several important things to understand with respect to this axiom:
•One canalwaysconstruct a reference frame which locally “looks” like the flat Minkowski space of
special relativity. This is a theorem, and not part of the equivalence principle. We shall deal with
this construction below.
•Given the above locally inertial (or locally Minkowskian) frame of reference, it is a matter ofphysics
to specify whether all laws look like in special relativity or not. The statement that they do is the
nontrivial part of equivalence principle, and it defines theinteraction  of  gravity  with  other
fields.
TheMinkowski spacetimehas three very important properties:
•It istorsion-free and flat, which means thatT
T
T= 0 andR
R
R= 0. This in turn means that one can
choose a special coordinate basise
e
e
i
where all connection coefficients vanish:
Γ

= 0.
We use Latin indices instead of Greek to distinguish this special basis from all other arbitrary bases.
•ItsdimensionisD= 4.
•It has a concept ofdistance, defined via theline element formula

:

The concept of distance isfundamentalto the Minkowski space, and in general.
Of course, in Minkowski space as in any other, one is not required to work in the special basise
e
e
i
.
One can transform from this basis into another arbitrary oneusing the transformation matricesM
μ
i
and
M
i
μ
defined earlier. But now we shall introduce another notationfor these matrices,e
e
e
μ
i
ande
e
e
i
μ
, and
call themtetrads. Using the tetrads, one can transform the metric tensorg

The metric, being a (0,2)-tensor, can be used to define several other concepts:
•Square of themagnitude of a vector:
||A
A
A||

g
g[A
A

e

[e

] =g
μν
A
μ
A
ν
.
Note that due to the one minus sign inη
μν
the square of this magnitude can be positive, negative
or zero, for nonzero vectorA
A
A. We therefore distinguish betweenspacelike, timelikeandnull(or
lightlike) vectors, respectively.
•Thescalar productof two vectors:

B

.
Note that this scalar product is not positive-definite. Alsonote that the square of the magnitude
of the vector is actually the scalar product with itself. Finally, note that we use the same “dot”
symbol for both the scalar product and inner product. This will be explained in more detail below.
•The scalar product and magnitude of 1-forms is defined in the analogous way, usingg
g
g
−1
.
•If one chooses some coordinate frame, the basis 1-forms can be written in the forme
e
e
μ
=d
d
dx
μ
, and
one can write the (more rigorous and fancy)differential geometry line elementas:
d

=g

g=g

One typically omits the⊗and writesdinstead ofd
d
d, thereby recoveringds

=g

μ
dx

. The
latter equation is actually just the former one written in sloppy notation.
Once we have introduced the metric, we can generalize to non-Minkowski space. The metric on a
general manifold has the same properties as in flat Minkowskicase. The only difference is that one has
one “copy” of Minkowski space at each pointPon the manifold, and covering only infinitesimal area
around the point.  This means that at each point one can alwayschoose a basise
e
e
i
whereg
ij
=η
ij
.
However, in generalthis basis is a noncoordinate basis, which means that one cannot choose a set
of coordinate curves which would generate this basis. If this were possible, in these coordinates the space
would look flat and with no torsion, which is equivalent to Minkowski space. But given that the basis is
noncoordinate, one has nonzero commutation coefficientsc
λ
μν
which give rise to nonzero curvature and
torsion.

3.2  Associated tensors, index gymnastics
Using the metric tensor and its inverse, we can construct inner products with some other tensor, thereby
obtaining a new tensor.  This new tensor is calledassociated  tensor, and in component notation
this operation is calledraising  and  lowering  of  indices. Namely, starting from some tensorA
A
A=
A
μν
λ
e
e
e
μ
⊗e
e
e
ν
⊗e
e
e
λ
, we can construct the inner product with the metric:

A=g

A
A=g
ρμ
A
μν
λ
e
e
e
ρ

e

where we see that the components of
 ̃
A
A

 ̃
A
ρ

λ
=g
ρμ
A
μν
λ
. The tilde symbol is usually dropped and
 ̃
A
A
Ais identified withA
A
Asince they are in one-to-one correspondence with each other. We say that we use
the metric tensor tolower the contravariant index.
Similarly we can use the inverse metric tensor toraise the covariant index, as:
 ̃
A
A
A=g
g
g

A
A=g

or in components

=g
ρλ
A
μν
λ
.
Given that metric tensor is invertible, one can always associate the associated tensor back to the
original one, without any loss of information. Thus, through the process of association, the metric tensor
enables us toignore the distinction between the covariant and contravariantnature of (p, q)-
tensors, and to keep track only of the total tensor rank,p+q. This is heavily used in practice, and in
combination with other operations enables us to construct new tensors from old.
As we have seen earlier, all operations on tensors can be represented in component language as
manipulations with indices. All practical computations with tensors are typically done this way, and
informally go by the nameindex gymnastics. Abstract (boldface) language is used to understand the
geometric nature of tensors, while any serious nontrivial computation can almost always be performed
much more efficiently using component language and index gymnastics.
3.3  Nonmetricity, classification of geometries
Up to now we have introduced two important concepts that characterize the manifold — connection
coefficentsΓ

(or equivalently the concept of gradient operator,

(or
equivalently the metric tensor,g

other. However, a lot of information about the differential structure of the manifold can be learned by
examining the relation between them. This leads us to several important results and gives new insight
into the structure of the geometry of the manifold.
The key relation between metric and connection is embodied in taking thegradient of the metric,
thereby constructing a new tensor:

g= 0 (calledmetricity  condition) imposes more special structure.
The resulting space is calledRiemann-Cartan space, and denotedU

{

•Additional requirementT

T= 0 (zero  torsion  condition) imposes even more special structure.

in four dimensions. The connection
coefficients obtain the form
Γ
λ
μν
=
{

+ ∆

One can always choose to work in acoordinate basis, where the commutation coefficients are
zero. In this basis the connection becomes equal to the Christoffel symbol,Γ
λ
μν
=
{
λ

, and is
calledLevi-Civita connection.
•Yet another requirement,R
R
R= 0 (flat space condition) specifies theMinkowski space, denoted
M

in four dimensions. In this space one can always choose a special basis such that the connection
vanishes:
Γ

= 0.
•Alternatively, if one starts from the Riemann-Cartan spaceU
4
and imposes the flat-space condition
R
R
R= 0 while keeping the torsion nonzero, one arrives at theWeitzenb ̈ock’s teleparallel space,
denotedT

T= 0 leads again to Minkowski spaceM

theory of relativity lives in the Riemann spaceV

3.4  Cartan structure equations, calculation of curvature

usually written using the natural spherical coordinates ofa 3-sphere,χ,θ,φ, and timet, as:

From here we simply read off the nonzero components of the curvature tensor in the locally inertial frame:

.
Finally, we use the tetrads to convert these components backto the original coordinate frame, to obtain
the final result:

All other components are obtained from these using various symmetries of the curvature tensor.
This completes the calculation of curvature. Once curvature tensor has been computed, it is straight-
forward and easy to construct the components of Ricci tensor, scalar curvature and Einstein tensor, using
